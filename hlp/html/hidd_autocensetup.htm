    <P>This dialog box allows you to set the beam intensity and other conditions for 
        centering the beam automatically. Essentially, you need to set the beam to a size appropriate for the method of 
      autocentering to be used, then you may need to adjust the exposure time and binning to 
      avoid saturating the camera.&nbsp; You can take pictures from within this 
      dialog to check both of these adjustments. The autocentering routine can use 
      two methods: finding the edges of the beam, as the <A HREF="menu_tasks.htm#hid_tasks_centerbeam">
        Center Beam command</A> does, or simply measuring the average location 
      (centroid) of all the counts in an image containing the whole beam. When the beam 
        edges are sharp enough, which may be the case only for FEG microscopes, the 
        edge-finding method is preferred because the centroid method requires a greater intensity change and 
      requires two images to avoid an error if part of the beam is out of the image. 
        To use the centroid method, you 
      need to make the beam substantially smaller than the camera field, with the 
      diameter perhaps half to two-thirds the size of the camera.&nbsp; The centroid will also be off from the beam center if the sample causes large 
      gradients in intensity.</P>
      <P>The edge-finding method can be applied with or without shifting the beam to bring 
          a large portion of edge into view.&nbsp; If no initial shift is applied, the 
          beam needs to be adjusted so that you can see a substantial fraction (1/3 to 
          1/2) of its edge in the four corners of the field.&nbsp; If the beam is not 
          reliably close to circular, it should be adjusted&nbsp;until it is just 
          inscribed in the camera field of view; there should be no need to make it 
          smaller than that.</P>
      <P>With an initial shift applied, the beam can be larger than the camera field, 
          perhaps up to twice as big.&nbsp; This option provides one solution if the beam 
          shifts its position when condensed small enough to use it without any shift.&nbsp; 
          An amount of shift should be applied that will bring the edge close to the 
          center of the field when the beam starts out centered.&nbsp; A non-circular beam 
          will definitely give a biased result when analyzing much less than half the beam 
          edge, but in practice this may be acceptable. </P>
    <P>The program can store the settings to control the autocentering separately for 
      each spot size, magnification, and camera. In addition, separate settings can 
      be stored for intensities on either side of condenser crossover. This does not 
      mean that you always need to set up parameters for every set of conditions. To 
      a limited extent, the program will derive settings for a particular mag and 
      spot size from the settings for a nearby mag and spot. However, it cannot 
      transfer settings from one camera to another or from one side of crossover to 
      another.</P>
      <P>This dialog is non-modal (as of SerialEM 3.8.0, 7/1/19), which means other 
          operations are allowed while the dialog is open.&nbsp; Two incompatible 
          operations are prevented when the dialog is open: changing the current camera 
          and turning Low Dose mode on or off.&nbsp; Other tasks and complex operations will 
          temporarily disable all the controls in the dialog.</P>
      <P>There are some fundamental differences in the way the dialog behaves and how you 
          can adjust settings depending on whether Low Dose mode is on or off.</P>
      <P><em><strong>With Low Dose mode off</strong></em>, beam adjustment is enabled by turning on the option <B>Setup beam on scope and track scope state</B>, 
          which links the settings shown in the dialog to the state of the microscope.&nbsp; 
          When the option is turned on, the microscope is switched to the state specified 
          by the dialog parameters. Changes in the dialog will be imposed on the 
          microscope; changes on the microscope will be reflected in the dialog.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          The <strong>Bigger</strong> and <strong>Smaller</strong> buttons will be enabled 
          to adjust beam size, and the <strong>Test Acquire</strong> button is enabled 
          because the scope is already in the needed state.&nbsp; Changing the spot size, 
          magnification, or probe mode in either the dialog or the microscope will switch 
          the dialog to a different parameter set, and scope intensity will be set to the 
          intensity setting of the new parameter set.</P>
    <P>You can set up these parameters by adjusting the beam to a likely size on the 
      viewing screen, then taking an image with <strong>Test Acquire</strong>. Adjust the beam size 
      as needed using the buttons or the
        <a href="menu_tasks.htm#hid_process_setintensity">Set Intensity</a> command in 
        the Tasks menu, and reduce the exposure time or binning to avoid camera saturation. 
      These latter values are originally based on the Trial camera parameter set.</P>
      <P><strong>&nbsp;<em>In Low Dose mode</em></strong>, autocentering images are taken 
          with the Trial area microscope parameters, and only the intensity can be changed 
          from the current Trial microscope state.&nbsp; The exposure time and binning can 
          also be changed; they are initially based on those of the Trial parameter set.&nbsp; 
          Here are points to be aware of:</P>
      <ul>
          <li>The magnification and spot size spin buttons are disabled and only reflect the 
              current settings of the Trial area.&nbsp; </li>
          <li>There is no specific option to control whether changes in intensity will be 
              linked between the scope and dialog.&nbsp; Instead, this tracking of state is 
              enabled in two conditions: when the screen is down and Trial is the current 
              area; or when Trial images are being taken in continuous mode.&nbsp; 
              Essentially, state is tracked when you can immediately assess the affects of 
              intensity changes, so one way of setting the beam size is to adjust intensity 
              while the screen is down or in continuous mode.</li>
          <li>If the screen is lowered, or is down when the dialog is opened, the program 
              switches to the Trial area and intensity is tracked.&nbsp; You will still need 
              to unblank the beam if it is blanked.</li>
          <li>If intensity is being tracked by either means, turning on <strong>Continuous 
              update</strong> in the Low Dose panel will stop the intensity tracking and 
              re-apply the stored Trial intensity.&nbsp; After that, changes in intensity will 
              change the Trial parameters, not the autocentering intensity.&nbsp; (The program 
              turns off <strong>Continuous update</strong> when you open this dialog.)</li>
          <li>Intensity tracking will also be stopped if you change magnification, spot size, 
              or probe mode away from their values in the Trial area.&nbsp; This prevents 
              changes in intensity associated with those changes from affecting the autocentering intensity.</li>
          <li>Instead of the checkbox to track the scope state, the program has a status line 
              to indicate whether state is being tracked.</li>
          <li>The <strong>Bigger,</strong> <strong>Smaller</strong> and <strong>Test Acquire</strong> 
              buttons are all enabled regardless of whether state is being tracked.&nbsp; 
              Thus, another way to set the intensity for autocentering is to use the first two 
              buttons to adjust the intensity and the <strong>Test Acquire</strong> button to 
              take an image with that intensity applied.&nbsp; If you take single Trial images 
              by any other means, the current Trial intensity is used instead.</li>
      </ul>
    <P><B>Source of settings</B></P>
    <P>This line reports whether the currently shown settings are stored values 
      specific to this spot size and magnification, or whether they have been derived 
      from a different spot size and/or magnification. If settings are derived, then 
      as soon as you modify them in any way (i.e., change intensity, binning, 
      exposure, or centering method), they will be stored and shown as directly set.</P>
    <P><B>Setup beam on scope and track scope state</B></P>
    <P>As explained above, this option appears only outside of Low Dose mode and 
        sychronizes the dialog and 
      microscope states.&nbsp; With 
      the option off, you can change the mag or spot size selectors to look at 
      different parameter sets without affecting the microscope; you can also change 
      binning or exposure time but not intensity.</P>
    <P><B>Spot size and Mag readouts and selectors</B></P>
    <P>The controls let you see the current magnification and spot size of 
      the dialog, which determine which parameter set is displayed.&nbsp; Outside of low 
        dose, you can also change these parameters with the spin buttons.&nbsp; If you 
        want to use these buttons to browse through the parameter sets and possibly 
        delete some, you should open the dialog with Low Dose mode off.&nbsp; Even the 
        sets added in Low Dose mode will be displayed.</P>
    <P><B>Intensity readout</B></P>
    <P>The intensity setting in the current parameter set is displayed but can only be 
        modified when the scope state is being tracked.</P>
    <P><B>Smaller - Bigger</B></P>
    <P>The buttons will decrease or increase the beam diameter by about 10%.&nbsp; For 
        smaller changes, use the <a href="menu_tasks.htm#hid_process_setintensity">Set Intensity</a> 
        command in the Tasks menu or the intensity spin button in the
        <a href="hidd_remotecontrol.htm">Microscope Control</a> panel.</P>
    <P><B>Binning</B></P>
    <P>Use the spin buttons to set the binning of the exposure. Binning can be reduced 
      to avoid saturation from a bright beam when exposure time is already as low as 
      feasible.</P>
    <P><B>Exposure</B></P>
    <P>The exposure time is shown and can be changed in this text box.
    </P>
    <P><B>Beam centering method</B></P>
    <P>These radio buttons allow you to choose between finding edges and using 
      centroids, as described above.</P>
      <P><strong>Find edges with beam shifted</strong></P>
      <P>Use this option to shift the beam before finding the edges, which allows a beam 
          larger than the field of view to be used for centering.&nbsp; This provides a 
          way to avoid problems with the beam being constricted so that enough edges show, 
          such as the beam shifting when condensed that much.&nbsp; The shift should be 
          enough to bring the edge of the beam near the center of the field.&nbsp; With 
          Low Dose mode off, the beam is shifted on a diagonal to maximize the beam edge 
          in the field; in Low Dose mode, the beam is shifted perpendicular to the axis 
          between Record and Trial to avoid impinging on either the Record area or another 
          more distant area.&nbsp; The shift can be either negative or positive and 
          determines the direction of movement.</P>
      <P><strong>Record shift</strong></P>
      <P>This feature can be used to leave the beam miscentered by a desired amount after 
          centering it.&nbsp; This would provide a second way to deal with a consistent 
          shift between the beam used for centering and the uncondensed beam, but it can 
          also be used to bias the position of the beam away from the Record area for an 
          extra margin of safety.&nbsp; It works like the <strong>Set</strong> button in 
          the Low Dose panel: the program will keep track of the beam shift from when you 
          turn on the checkbox to when you turn it off.&nbsp; After you turn it off, the 
          shift will be shown to the right of the <strong>Reset</strong> button, in microns on the camera.</P>
      <P>To correct for a consistent shift in the condensed beam used for autocentering:</P>
      <ol>
          <li>&nbsp;Autocenter the beam.</li>
          <li>Turn on the checkbox.</li>
          <li>If in Low Dose mode, turn on <strong>Continuous update</strong> to stop tracking 
              state and see the uncondensed beam wth the screen down.&nbsp; If not in Low 
              Dose, turn off tracking of the scope state.</li>
          <li>Center the uncondensed beam.&nbsp; </li>
          <li>Turn off the checkbox.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
          To mis-center the beam deliberately, you need to follow the same steps if you 
          want to see the beam with the screen down or in continuous mode, except that 
          step 4 would be to mis-center the beam.&nbsp; If you want to take single-shot 
          images and move the beam in steps manually or with the Microscope Control panel buttons, you 
          can omit step 3 in Low Dose mode.</p>
      <P><strong>Reset/Abort</strong></P>
      <P>When not recording a shift, this button is labeled 'Reset' and will clear out a 
          recorded shift.&nbsp; When recording a shift, it is labeled 'Abort' and lets you 
          stop recording a shift without losing the previous value.</P>
      <P><B>Test Acquire</B></P>
    <P>Use this button to take an image with the current settings and see how large the 
      beam is and whether it is saturating the camera. The screen will be restored to its state before taking the picture 
      unless you are in Low Dose mode.</P>
    <P><B>Delete Settings</B></P>
    <P>The button can be used to delete stored settings, which might be useful if you 
      need to change settings substantially and want to start with one derived from 
      another mag or spot size where you have already changed the settings.</P>
