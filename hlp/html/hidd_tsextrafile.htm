      <P>This dialog is used to control the saving of images to additional image buffers 
        or files during a tilt series. The final Record or montage overview can be 
        binned down and saved in buffers shown in a separate window. Four different 
        types of images can be saved to files. First, the various tracking images taken 
        by the Tilt Series Controller, and autofocus pictures, can be saved to files. 
        Second, additional Record images can be saved at different defocus levels, or 
        at different energy filter settings. These extra Record images are taken after 
        the normal Record or montage is taken, and are saved to a separate file from 
        the main tilt series to maintain the linkage between tilt and image number in 
        the latter file. An entry will appear in the log for each image saved to an 
        extra output file.&nbsp; Third, in Low Dose mode a pair of Trial images can be 
        saved, one from the other side of the Record area.&nbsp; These images are taken 
        like extra Record images, after the&nbsp;normal Record is taken, but they are 
        not constrained to being at the same binning as regular Trial images.&nbsp; 
        Fourth, in STEM mode, images from other detectors than the primary one can be 
        saved into a file.&nbsp; When there is more than one extra Record image, they 
        can each be saved into a separate file instead of all into the same file.</P>
    <P>When acquiring multiple tilt series through the Navigator, it is possible to 
      have one or more extra files opened for each tilt series and closed at the end of the 
      series.&nbsp; Set up a script with the line<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SuffixForExtraFile&nbsp; suffix1 
      suffix2 ...<br />
      where &#39;suffix1&#39;, 
      &#39;suffix2&#39;, etc, will be added to the root of the filename of the regular tilt 
      series output file.&nbsp; For example, if the regular filename is &#39;series1.mrc&#39; 
      and a suffix is &#39;_trial&#39;, the extra file will be named &#39;series1_trial.mrc&#39;.&nbsp; 
      In the
      <A HREF="hidd_navacquire.htm">Navigator Acquire dialog</A>, turn on the option 
      to run a script before the main action and select the script with this command.&nbsp; 
      The extra files will be opened before the regular file, so set the file numbers 
      for the extra output to start from 1 if there will be no other files open when 
      the acquisition is started.&nbsp; If there will be other files open, start the file 
      numbers one past the number of the highest file that will be open.</P>
      <P><B>Stack Record/Overview images in separate window</B></P>
      <P>Select this check box to display binned down Record or montage overview images 
        in a window separate from the main window. This window will initially be opened 
        at half the size of the binned images, and its title will be the name of the 
        tilt series output file. When the window is the active one, hot keys can be 
        used as usual to scroll through and zoom the display. (It may be necessary to 
        click inside the window with the mouse to make it active.) Images will be 
        labeled by their number in the buffer stack and by the Z value of the 
        corresponding image in the output file.</P>
      <P>This option can be turned on and off at any time during a series. If the window 
        is closed, a new window will be opened when the next image is ready to be 
        shown, but the previous images will be gone. At the end of tilt series, the 
        window will no longer accept new images but it will be left open until you 
        close it. If you start a new tilt series, a new window will be opened for its 
        images.</P>
      <P><B>Bin to N KB/image</B></P>
      <P>This spin button lets you control how much the images are binned by adjusting 
        the maximum memory allowed for each image. The memory requirement is the 
        primary concern when keeping a stack that may contain over 100 images; for this 
        reason, the displayed images are converted to bytes as well as binned down. The 
        kilobytes per image and the maximum size of a square image are shown as you 
        change this setting. The maximum size is limited by default to 512 by 512 
        pixels; this limit can be changed with a 'MaxStackWindowSizeXY' entry in the 
        properties file.</P>
      <P><B>View, Focus, Trial, Preview check boxes</B></P>
      <P>These check boxes govern whether images of the particular type will be saved 
        during the tilt series. You can change these selections at any point in the 
        series.
      </P>
      <P><B>File # and Name spin buttons</B></P>
      <P>The spin buttons allow you to select a file number in which each kind of image 
        will be saved. They can be set to file numbers up to the maximum number of 
        image files allowed. If there is already an open file at a file number, its 
        name will be shown; otherwise the selector will show 'Not open yet'. When the 
        tilt series is started or resumed, the program will check the validity of the 
        indicated file for each of the kinds of images being saved. Basically, each 
        file must be compatible with images of the given type, based on the current 
        camera parameters for taking that type of image. You can save different kinds 
        of images into the same file as long as they have the same dimensions. You may 
        not save any extra images into the main tilt series output file.</P>
    <P>Montaged files cannot be selected for saving anything except extra Record 
      images in TEM mode (i.e., a montaged file is not allowed for saving opposite 
      Trials or STEM mode).&nbsp; You will most likely want a montage that is the same 
      size as the main output, but this is not required or done automatically by the 
      program; you have to set up the montage of the needed size when you open the 
      output file.</P>
    <P><b>Save multiple Records in consecutive files</b></P>
    <P>Select this option to have each extra Record image at one tilt angle saved into 
      a separate file, where the file numbers are consecutive from the one selected 
      with the spin button.&nbsp; With the option turned on, a line below this will 
      show whether these additional files are open yet.</P>
      <P><B>Extra Record/Trial radio buttons and text box</B></P>
      <P style="Z-INDEX: 0">These buttons select whether one or more Record images are 
        saved at different focus or filter settings or from different STEM detectors, or whether a pair of Trial images 
        are taken. When&nbsp;a focus&nbsp;or filter series is selected, the text box is 
        enabled and a series of entries can be made. Entries must be separated by 
        spaces.</P>
      <P>For a focus series, the values to enter are the change in focus from the current 
        defocus target. Separate multiple values with spaces, e.g., '-2 -4 2'.</P>
      <P>For a filter series, each entry consists of two values separated by a comma. The 
        first value specifies the slit width: 0 to filter with the current width, -1 to 
        take an image with the slit open, or a value greater than 0 to filter with the 
        given width. The second value specifies the change in energy loss from the 
        current value; positive and negative values are allowed. For example, if the 
        regular Record image is set up to be zero-loss filtered with a slit width of 
        20, then entries of '-1,0 0,40 50,20' would result in three extra Record 
        images: an unfiltered image, one with the regular slit width of 20 eV and an 
        energy loss of 40 eV, and one with a slit width of 50 eV and an energy loss of 
        20 eV.</P>
    <P>When you select the option to save images from multiple STEM detectors, the 
      dialog will show a line listing the numbers of the detectors that will be 
      acquired simultaneously with the main Record image, based on the current 
      selection in the Record parameter set.&nbsp; Up to 6 channels can be acquired 
      from simultaneously during a tilt series; this limit could easily be raised.&nbsp; Separate 
      acquisitions are needed to acquire from more than this number of detectors, or 
      to acquire from ones that cannot be used simultaneously with the main Record 
      detector.&nbsp; Enter a space-separated list of additional channels to acquire 
      in separate acquisitions in the text box.&nbsp; Note that when acquiring from 
      more than 3 simultaneous channels during a tilt series, the number of rolling 
      buffers is set to the number of simultaneous channels, and the alignment and 
      read buffers are shifted to higher buffers.</P>
      <P><B>Changes for Extra Records/Trials</B></P>
      <P>The options in this group allow you to change the beam or the camera acquisition 
        parameters for the extra Record or Trial images. Redundant methods are provided 
        because there may be problems with one or two of them in any given case. </P>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter 
        a number different from 1 in 'Change intensity by factor of' to have the 
        intensity changed by that factor and restored at the end. </li>
      <li>Select the 'Change 
        Spot size to' checkbox and set the spinner to the desired value to have the 
        spot size changed. </li>
      <li>Select the 'Set exposure to' checkbox to have the exposure 
        time and drift settling set to the values in the text boxes. The drift settling 
        will be applied only for if appropriate for the given camera and shuttering 
        mode, even though the 'Drift settling' text box is not disabled in such cases.&nbsp; 
        The exposure time entry can be one or more values separated by spaces, where a 0 
        means to leave the exposure unchanged from the value for the previous image, and 
        there do not need to be as many values as extra Records.&nbsp; For example, if 
        you have a filter series with 5 extra Records, you can enter &#39;0. 3. 0. 7.&#39; and 
        the exposure will be the same as a regular Record for the first extra Record, 3. 
        for the second and third, and 7. for the fourth and fifth.</li>
      <li>Finally, if you are doing a pair of Trial images, you can select 'Set Trial 
        binning to' and set the binning for these images with the spinner.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Keep file with bidirectional anchor images</b></p>
    <p>
      Normally, the program stores the initial anchor image for a bidirectional tilt 
      series in a file and deletes the file at the end of the tilt series.&nbsp; If 
      this option is selected, the image used to realign to the anchor is appended to 
      the file and the file is not deleted.</p>
