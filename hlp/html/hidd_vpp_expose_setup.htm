        Phase Plate Conditioning Setup Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog allows you to set parameters for conditioning a Volta phase plate,
      namely exposing it to the beam for long enough to build up an appropriate charge
      on it. It also has a buttons to start the conditioning, either at the current
      phase plate position or after moving to the next position.&nbsp; It has options
      to move the phase plate to its next position (if supported) and to do the
      conditioning at a different location on the specimen. The conditioning routine
      operates by lowering the screen to unblank the beam.&nbsp; It returns the
      screen, beam blanking, and other scope settings to their original state when it
      is allowed to run to completion.&nbsp; If you stop the routine during the
      conditioning or during a step before that with the STOP button in the Camera and
      Script Control panel, it will still do the steps needed to return to the
      original position and state before ending.&nbsp; However, if you press STOP 3
      times it will abandon those steps.</p>
    <p><strong>Beam settings to use</strong></p>
    <p>The radio buttons allow you select the how the beam is set up for the exposure.&nbsp;
      The conditioning can be done either in Low Dose mode or not.&nbsp; In Low Dose
      mode, there is a choice of using the Record area, the Trial area, or separate
      set of conditions that are recorded with the dialog open.&nbsp; Exposure with
      the Trial settings is done off-axis, in the Trial area; the other settings
      expose the specimen on-axis.&nbsp; Outside of Low Dose mode, only the separate
      settings can be used.</p>
    <p><strong>Set up mag and beam on scope</strong></p>
    <p>When <strong>Settings displayed here</strong> is selected, this option can be
      selected to start tracking the current microscope settings.&nbsp; If settings
      already exist, they are imposed when the option is checked.&nbsp; The previous
      state of the microscope is restored when the option is unchecked.
          </p>
    <p><strong>Expose with charge of n nC</strong></p>
    <p>With this option selected, the program will expose for a time that will result
      in the total charge specified in the edit box in nanoCoulombs.&nbsp; This should
      give the most reproducible result and overcome variations in beam brightness,
      provided that the beam is entirely on the viewing screen.</p>
    <p><strong>Expose for time of n sec</strong></p>
    <p>With this option selected, the program will simply expose for the time
      specified in the edit box in seconds.</p>
    <p><strong>Delay if moving to next PP position</strong></p>
    <p>When the conditioning operation is to be done after moving to a new phase plate
      position, this entry specifies a settling time after moving to the next
      position.</p>
    <p><strong>Do conditioning at nearest Navigator point with</strong></p>
    <p>It is possible to do the conditioning at one or more specially designated
      locations instead of at the current location.&nbsp; You can specify a Navigator
      point to be used by starting either its Label or its Note with the entry in the
      text box; select <strong>Label</strong> or <strong>Note</strong> to indicate
      which to use.&nbsp; There can be several such items in the Navigator table; the
      program will find the nearest one and go to that one.&nbsp; When acquiring through the Navigator, if a Realign to Item
      has already been done for the current item, then the program will take a
      reference image before going to the other location, do the conditioning there,
      and take a new image to align to the reference after returning to the
      acquisition point&#39;s position.&nbsp; Currently this is the only situation in
      which this realignment will be done when conditioning at a separate location.&nbsp;
      As for other tasks, this alignment is done with View images in Low Dose mode,
      otherwise with parameters based on the Trial camera parameter set.&nbsp;
          </p>
    <p><strong>Action buttons</strong></p>
    <p>All of the buttons at the bottom close the dialog.&nbsp; Press <strong>Close</strong>
      to save parameters, <strong>Cancel</strong> to discard them, <strong>Go</strong>
      to run the conditioning routine at the current location, and <strong>Next &amp; Go</strong>
      to condition after moving the phase plate to its next position.&nbsp; (Moving to
      the next position is available on the JEOL CryoARM and on Thermo/FEI scopes with a new
      enough version of Advanced Scripting.)</p>
