      <P>Many parameters can be set in SerialEM through the properties file. They all
        have default values in the program, and in most cases the values in the
        properties file are the defaults. A property is entered by having a line with a
        keyword followed by one or more values. The keywords are
        case-insensitive, but they are most readable when shown in the MixedCase form 
        used here. Values can be separated by any number of spaces or
        tabs.</P>
    <P>The properties file can have comments starting with #.&nbsp; Any line starting
      with # will be ignored.&nbsp; A property containing numeric entries can have a
      comment after the numbers.&nbsp; <b>However, a property specifying a general
      string entry (for example, any string that might have spaces, like a path entry
      or camera or detector name) cannot have a comment on the same
      line because it will be considered part of the entry.</b></P>
    <P>The file can also have multiline comments starting with '/*' and ending on a line
      containing '*/'.&nbsp; The '/*' <b>must</b> be at the start of the line, whereas the
      '*/' can be anywhere on the ending line.&nbsp; This makes it easy to comment out 
      a section of entries.</P>

             are placed in this title.&nbsp;Such characters may cause problems in software
             reading file headers.&nbsp; IMOD seems to work with Unicode, but single-byte characters

          <TD>PathToPython</TD>
          <TD>Version number and path to directory of a Python installation containing 'python.exe'.&nbsp; The
             version number should start with two digits with a period between them.&nbsp; For Python 3.4 or
            below (i.e. 2.7), where modules are named 'serialem.pyd' and must be in separate subdirectories,
            this version string is added to the module path, so it must match the name of the subdirectory,
             i.e., 3.4-32, 3.4-64, or 2.7 if using the standard package or modules.&nbsp; If you have both 32- and
            64-bit installations (e.g., for Python 3.5), you should include '-32' and '-64' on these strings
            so that the '#!Python' entry at the start of a script can be used to pick which one to run.&nbsp; There
            can be multiple entries of this property, or none if there is just one Python you wish to use and it

          <TD>AssumeDPI</TD>
          <TD>Follow with a DPI value to use in font and dialog scaling instead of the
              detected one.&nbsp; This enables the program to be scaled independently of the
              Windows scaling or DPI setting.&nbsp; If you want to scale for 120 DPI, you will also need
              to set &#39;DisplayIsNot120DPI 0&#39;</TD>
        </TR>
        <TR VALIGN="top">
          <TD>DisplayIsNot120DPI</TD>
          <TD>The program detects the display resolution (DPI, dots per inch) when it starts
            and by default it modifies font sizes and some constants if it is not 120 DPI.&nbsp;
              When it is 120 DPI, it assumes that this is a Thermo/FEI scope where monitor scaling
              was set to 120 DPI even though the monitor was probably 96 DPI, and it sets the
              variable controlled by this property to 1 to prevent the scaling.&nbsp; Set this
              property to 0 if the display really is 120 DPI (e.g., a laptop screen) and you
              want the program to scale just as for other DPIs.&nbsp; Setting to 1 will
              prevent scaling if you enter 120 for the &#39;AssumeDPI&#39;&nbsp; property.</TD>

          <TD>Follow with three numbers: 0; the extra height to add to control panels; and the extra width
            to add to control panels.&nbsp; The defaults for height and width are 5, and 8 for DPI &lt; 120,
            0, and 0 for DPI = 120, and 6, and 10 for DPI &gt; 120.  The first value used
            to be the title bar height but this is now handled properly.</TD>

        <TR VALIGN="top">
          <TD>StartAsAdministrator</TD>
          <TD>Set to 1 to turn on Administrator mode when starting the program, or -1 to prevent

          <TD>Full path name of a default file listing dialog and menu items to be disabled or
            hidden when <a href="menu_settings.htm#hid_settings_basicmode">
            Basic Mode</a> is turned on in the Settings menu.&nbsp; Since the Basic Mode
            filename is saved in the settings file as of SerialEM 4.1, 30-Nov-22, this entry
            just provides a default if no Basic
            Mode file name was read in from settings.&nbsp; If a filename is provided in neither
            file, the program looks for and reads SEMbasicModeItems.txt in the system
            directory.&nbsp; See <A HREF="about_hide_disable.htm">Hiding and Disabling Menu and Dialog Items</A> for details.</TD>

          <TD>Set to 1 to prevent the program from reading in "Short term calibrations" when
            starting and from saving them when exiting. This might be useful when first
            setting up the program if there are troubles with image shift calibrations,
            but it is better to use the menu entry to remove bad calibrations instead,
            since rotation and pixel size measurements are stored in this file too.</TD>
        </TR>
        <TR VALIGN="top">
          <TD>MaxStackWindowSizeXY</TD>
          <TD>This setting controls the maximum size of binned images that will be displayed
            in a separate window during a tilt series. Enter the maximum size for a square
            image; rectangular images will be binned to have no more pixels than a square
            image of this size. The default is 512.</TD>
        </TR>
        <TR VALIGN="top">
          <TD>TotalMemoryLimitMB</TD>
          <TD>Limit on the total memory that the program should use for image
            buffers and camera reference images, in megabytes. This limit is applied when
            the program is requesting memory for a montage overview image, acquisition
            image, or display buffer, the situations where the largest images can get
            created.&nbsp; If the computer has 2 GB of memory or less, set this to the highest
            amount of memory that the program can comfortably use without causing swapping
            (e.g., perhaps 1200 for a 1.5 GB system). For a 3 GB system or a 4 GB system
            without the /3GB boot parameter, a value near 1900 might be appropriate to keep
            the program from running into the 2 GB memory limit. For a 4 GB system with the
            /3GB boot option set, this entry may not be needed, but 2700 would probably be a
            good value.&nbsp; The default&nbsp; is 75% of system memory for 32-bit versions
              with less than 2.4 GB and for 64-bit versions; for 32-bit versions with more
              memory, the default is 1.8 GB on a 32-bit system and 3.7 GB on a 64-bit system.</TD>

          <TD>This entry is used for STEM cameras and K2/K3 and Falcon cameras, as well as for
            DE cameras with a server version of 1.0.1243 or higher. <i>For a STEM camera</i>, use it
            to indicate whether to rotate and flip images after acquisition to make them
            match image orientation on the screen and other cameras.&nbsp; The value is the sum
            of 0-3 for the number of 90 degree rotations counterclockwise (e.g., 3 for 90
            degrees clockwise) plus 4 for flipping around the Y axis before the rotation.&nbsp;
            Set this before doing any calibrations that rely on image orientation. <i>For a K2/K3
            camera</i>, this entry indicates operations to be applied to dose fractionation
            images returned to SerialEM and to frames saved from the plugin by default.&nbsp;
            Even if frames are being saved without rotation and flip, the correct entry is
            needed here to keep DM from applying its own rotation.&nbsp; <i>For a
            Falcon camera</i>, the indicated operation is applied to intermediate frames.&nbsp;
            In general, it should be set when using frame alignment in SerialEM or IMOD so as to make
            the aligned image match unaligned ones.  &nbsp;
            For <i>Falcon 2</i>, it is applied to frames being saved, so setting it is optional if
            alignment is not being used.&nbsp; For <i>Falcon 3</i>, it is needed when aligning images.
            &nbsp; For <i>Falcon 4</i>, saved MRC frames are in the correct orientation but EER frames
            are in native orientation, so the setting is needed to make images aligned either with no
            saving selected or while also saving as EER have the right orientation.&nbsp;
            <i>For a DE camera</i>, the operation is applied after aligning saved frames; it
            should match the operation being done to images in the DE server. </TD>

            the mode if default parameters are available.&nbsp; For a Gatan camera, follow with up to 4 numbers:
            1 to use the mode or 0 not to; 1 to specify continuous readout or 0 not to; a
            quality level from 1 to 7 or 0 not to set quality; and 1 to balance intensity

            type is determined from the &#39;DMGainReferenceName&#39; property.&nbsp; If a
            property is entered for an Orius, be sure to include the fourth value to balance
            the two halves, unless using a quality level where it is not needed.&nbsp; For a
            DE camera, the use of live mode is specified by the first parameter, and the use
            of a separate thread that acquires in parallel with the display operations is
            specified by the second parameter; both values are set to 1 by default.&nbsp;
            For Tietz F216/F416/F816/XF416 cameras, the first parameter is 1 by default.
            &nbsp; For a plugin camera, just the first parameter is used to indicate that a

            DM for the image orientation.&nbsp; Enter the unbinned pixel just above the

          <TD>This entry does three things.&nbsp; For Falcon 3 with the Advanced Scripting

            and it sets the number of divisions by 2 applied to the data.&nbsp; If the value
            is 0 or negative (but greater than -10), then counting mode data will be divided
            by 2 the given number of times and linear mode data will be scaled to match;
            i.e., no division of counting mode values for 0, or division by 2, 4, 8, etc for
            for -1, -2, -3, etc.&nbsp; If the value is positive, then linear mode counts
            will be divided by 2 the given number of times, i.e., by 2, 4, 8, etc. for 1, 2,
            3, etc., and counting mode data will be scaled to match.&nbsp; Enter -10 to

            Falcon 3 with the standard scripting interface, it activates a scaling so that
            images with different exposures do not all have the same counts.&nbsp; Its value

            two cases: 1) when a Thermo/FEI scope can be recognized as of a newer generation, 
            namely when either it is a Titan or the program uses Advanced Scripting, the values 
            are changed internally to the new recommended values, listed below, and
            'ExtraISdelayPerMagDoubling' is changed to 0.1; or 2) for a JEOL scope, the 
            values are left as they are and 'ISdelayScaleFactor' is set to 0.2.<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a Talos or Glacios that can <i>not</i> be recognized because it does not use Advanced Scripting,
            it is recommended that the table be changed to these values:
            <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;   ImageShiftDelays 4
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;   0.1 0.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;   0.3 0.4

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;   1.0 0.5
            </br>
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the table is recognized as having these new values and 'ISdelayScaleFactor' is 1, 
            'ExtraISdelayPerMagDoubling' is changed to 0.1.
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the program adjusts values automatically in these 3 cases, it also changes the
             adjustment for camera startup in 'StartupForISDelays' from 0.8 to 0.25 to reflect the 
            new way that values were measured.
            To get a message on startup about whether defaults were recognized and values were changed,
            set 'DebugOutput' to '1' or a letter.

            accesses after the program changes mag. The second number provides for an
            additional time during which access to the stage will be deferred. If only one
            number is used, values of 2000 or more may be needed to prevent errors. With two

            the beam to one-eighth of the field past the upper left or lower right corner of
            the image, respectively (as of November 2015, this requires a DigiScan patch to
            work).&nbsp; With 8, it will simply retain control without any explicit beam
            positioning command.&nbsp; Shots will be taken synchronously with a 17 ms delay
