      <P>Many parameters can be set in SerialEM through the properties file. They all 
        have default values in the program, and in most cases the values in the 
        properties file are the defaults. A property is entered by having a line with a 
        keyword followed by one or more values. As of SerialEM 2.6.0, the keywords are 
        case-insensitive, but they are most readable when shown in the MixedCase form 
        that used to be required. Values can be separated by any number of spaces or 
        tabs.</P>
    <P>The properties file can have comments starting with #.&nbsp; Any line starting 
      with # will be ignored.&nbsp; A property containing numeric entries can have a 
      comment after the numbers.&nbsp; <b>However, a property specifying a general 
      string entry (for example, any path entry) cannot have a comment on the same 
      line beause it will be considered part of the entry.</b></P>

          <TD>The program detects the display resolution (DPI, dots per inch) when it starts 
            and by default it modifies font sizes and some constants if it is not 120 DPI.&nbsp; Set this 
            property to 0 to use the default font sizes and dialog scalings even if the 
            detected DPI is different from 120.&nbsp; Set it to 1 if the detected DPI is 120 
            and you enter a different value in the &#39;AssumeDPI&#39;&nbsp; property, so that both 
            dialog and font scaling will occur.</TD>

            a control panel; the extra height to add to control panels; and the extra width 
            to add to control panels.&nbsp; The defaults are 24, 5, and 8 for DPI &lt; 120, 24, 
            0, and 0 for DPI = 120, and<br />
            40, 6, and 10 for DPI &gt; 120.</TD>
        </TR>
        <TR VALIGN="top">

          <TD>Set this to 1 to have the program exit if errors occur when connecting to the 
            microscope.</TD>
        </TR>
        <TR VALIGN="top">
          <TD>StartAsAdministrator</TD>
          <TD>Set to 1 to turn on Administrator mode when starting the program.</TD>
        </TR>
        <TR VALIGN="top">
          <TD>IgnoreShortTermCals</TD>
          <TD>Set to 1 to prevent the program from reading in "Short term calibrations" when 
            starting and from saving them when exiting. This might be useful when first 
            setting up the program if there are troubles with image shift calibrations.</TD>
        </TR>
        <TR VALIGN="top">
          <TD>MaxStackWindowSizeXY</TD>
          <TD>This setting controls the maximum size of binned images that will be displayed 
            in a separate window during a tilt series. Enter the maximum size for a square 
            image; rectangular images will be binned to have no more pixels than a square 
            image of this size. The default is 512.</TD>
        </TR>
        <TR VALIGN="top">
          <TD>TotalMemoryLimitMB</TD>
          <TD>Limit on the total memory that the program should use for image 
            buffers and camera reference images, in megabytes. This limit is applied when 
            the program is requesting memory for a montage overview image, acquisition 
            image, or display buffer, the situations where the largest images can get 
            created.&nbsp; If the computer has 2 GB or memory or less, set this to the highest 
            amount of memory that the program can comfortably use without causing swapping 
            (e.g., perhaps 1200 for a 1.5 GB system). For a 3 GB system or a 4 GB system 
            without the /3GB boot parameter, a value near 1900 might be appropriate to keep 
            the program from running into the 2 GB memory limit. For a 4 GB system with the 
            /3GB boot option set, this entry may not be needed, but 2700 would probably be a 
            good value.</TD>
        </TR>
        <TR VALIGN="top">
          <TD>SkipGainRefWarning</TD>
          <TD>Set to 1 to suppress the warning that the spot was normalized before starting 
            to take a gain reference. This may be appropriate on a Tecnai F30.</TD>

          </TD>
          <TD>Enter one or more values to customize the circles that can be drawn on a live 
            FFT. The radius is expressed as fraction of the distance from the center to the 
            edge of the FFT (Nyquist frequency). The default is one circle at 0.33.
          </TD>
        </TR>
        <TR VALIGN="top">
          <TD>FFTZeroParams</TD>
          <TD>Parameters governing the display of circles at the expected zeros of the CTF

        <TR VALIGN="top">
          <TD>DefaultMaxCtfFitRes</TD>
          <TD>Default maximum resolution for CTF fitting, in Angstroms.&nbsp; This default 
            applies until the user enters a different value, at which point the resolution 
            becomes a user setting.&nbsp; The default value is 5 if the voltage on program 
            startup is &gt; 125, otherwise 10.</TD>
        </TR>
        <TR VALIGN="top">

          <TD>Name of an SMTP server (of the form 'machine.domain.edu') that will accept and 
            deliver email from SerialEM. To send email, this property and 'SendMailFrom' 
            must be defined and an address to send to must be entered with 'Set Email 
            Address' in the Tilt Series menu. There is a script command, 'SendEmail', that 
            can be used to test this capability.</TD>

        <TR VALIGN="top">
          <TD>SMTPPort</TD>
          <TD>Port to use for sending to the SMTP server; a default port will be used if

            or just machine.domain.edu. In the first case emails for all users will come 
            from the same name (which could be SerialEM); in the second case the user's name 
            will be added to the sending address, so that it will appear to come from you. 
            The address probably needs to look like a valid address but does not need to be 
            valid.</TD>

          <TD>Socket ID and IP address of a server that SerialEM will connect to through 
            its socket interface.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ID is an arbitrary positive number 
            specific to a type of server.&nbsp; ID 0 is assigned to the interface to the 
            SerialEMCCD plugin (so &#39;SocketServerIP 0 x.x.x.x&#39; has the same effect as 
            &#39;GatanServerIP x.x.x.x&#39;) and ID 1 is assigned to the interface in the 
            FEIScopePlugin that connects with a server on an FEI scope.&nbsp; Thus, use

            accesses after the program changes mag. The second number provides for an 
            additional time during which access to the stage will be deferred. If only one 
            number is used, values of 2000 or more may be needed to prevent errors. With two

          <TD>DigiScanExtraShotDelay</TD>
          <TD>As of SerialEM 3.1.1, this entry has two effects: 1) it is the delay time 
            between stopping continuous acquisition and deleting the parameters; 2) if it is 
            non-zero, single-shot DigiScan images will be taken asynchronously with a loop 
            to check if they are done, but if it is 0, images will be taken synchronously.&nbsp; 
            The latter will crash current versions of DM, but apparently not some future 
            version.&nbsp; The default 
            is 100 ms.</TD>

          <TD>Number of microseconds of waiting time to add when the Line Sync option is on 
            for taking DigiScan images.&nbsp; The pixel time will be constrained so that the 
            pixel scanning time plus the flyback time plus this wait equals an integral 
            number of line cycles.&nbsp; The default is 10 microsec.</TD>

          <TD>Follow with 1, 2, 4, or 8 to enable DigiScan to control beam position between 
            shots and return it to a good position.&nbsp; This requires GMS 2.2 or later.&nbsp; 
            With 1, it will move the beam to the safe position. With 2 or 4, it will move 
            the beam to one-eighth of the field past the upper left or lower right corner of 
            the image, respectively (as of November 2015, this requires a DigiScan patch to 
            work).&nbsp; With 8, it will simply retain control without any explicit beam 
            positioning command.&nbsp; Shots will be taken synchronously with a 17 ms delay

            a value of -1, they will be inverted when the button is NOT checked, so that 
            bright and dark field images will always have the same contrast polarity.</TD>
