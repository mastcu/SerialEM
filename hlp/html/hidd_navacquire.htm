    <P>This dialog opens when the 'Navigator-Acquire at Points' menu item is selected 
      and lets you control what actions are taken at a series of Navigator items 
      marked as 'Acquire' or 'Tilt Series'. For items marked as 'Acquire', the 
      primary actions available are to take and save an image, take an image and save 
      it as a map, or run a script at each point. If there are only items marked as 
      'Acquire', the Tilt Series option is unavailable; if there are only items 
      marked as 'Tilt Series', the other actions are unavailable. If there are both 
      kinds of items marked, the dialog will open with the Tilt series option 
      selected but the other options available; however, the selected action will be 
      taken only on the appropriate kind of item ('Acquire' or 'Tilt Series') and 
      items of the other kind will be skipped.
    </P>
    <P>Control of the tilt series or script acquisition after it is started is complex 
      because it involves two levels of activity: the Navigator acquisition and the 
      operation being run.&nbsp; Buttons in the Camera and Script control panel will 
      be modified and enabled to allow control at both of these levels.&nbsp; The 
      effect of these buttons is described for each action in the <b>Primary Task</b> 
      section below.</P>
    <P>Prior to the primary action are a series of optional steps that can be run after 
      moving the stage to each item's position. They are shown in the order in which 
      they would be run:</P>
    <P><B>Rough eucentricity - </B>The rough eucentricity task should be selected if it 
      is necessary that the specimen be eucentric and if the Z height might be off by 
      more than 10 microns. It is run first because it does not retain alignment to a 
      specimen position.</P>
    <P><B>Autocenter beam</B> - This task will condense the beam and take a picture to 
      determine how to recenter it. Beam autocentering must already be set up for the 
      current magnification in the <A HREF="hidd_autocensetup.htm">Beam Autocentering 
        Setup dialog box</A> .
    </P>
    <P><B>Realign to item - </B>This task will realign to a selected specimen feature, 
      but requires that the item be located within a sufficiently large 
      medium-magnification map, as described in <A HREF="menu_navigator.htm#hid_navigator_aligntoitem">
        Realign to Item</A> .&nbsp; If rough eucentricity is <i>not</i> being run 
      during the acquire sequence, then the realign operation will be done at the Z 
      height of the item being aligned to, since changing Z after aligning would lose 
      the alignment.&nbsp; However, if rough eucentricity <i>is</i> being run, then 
      the Z height found during that operation is retained for the realign operation.&nbsp; 
      Thus, a new map acquired at this position will have the right Z height.&nbsp; 
      There will be some error in realigning to the map because of the Z height 
      difference.&nbsp; This error will be recorded for the new map and taken into 
      account when realigning to this pair of maps in the future.</P>
    <P><B>Cook specimen</B> - This task will stabilize the specimen by pre-exposing it 
      for a certain amount of time or to achieve a certain dose. The parameters for 
      this operation must already be set up in the <A HREF="hidd_cooksetup.htm">Specimen 
        Cooking Setup dialog box</A> .</P>
    <P><B>Fine eucentricity -</B> This task can be selected if eucentricity needs to be 
      found with the highest accuracy, but the Z height should be within 10 microns 
      of eucentric before running this task. If 'Realign to item' was also selected, 
      the task is run in a way that maintains alignment to the specimen position (the <A HREF="menu_tasks.htm#hid_tasks_finerealign">
        Refine &amp; Realign command</A>).</P>
    <P><B>Autofocus -</B> Select this option to run the autofocus routine prior to the 
      main action. If 'Only at start of group' is checked, then autofocus is run only 
      when the first item in a group is encountered, or when an item is not a member 
      of a group. If the
    </P>
    <P><B>Run script</B> - This task is available as a preliminary action for all kinds 
      of 
      primary tasks.&nbsp; When the primary task is tilt series acquisition, the script 
      should be used for quick actions such as opening secondary files; if extended 
      tasks are performed, the script is responsible for maintaining alignment to the 
      specimen position. Even if the script is stopped or fails to complete 
      successfully, the program will go on to the primary task, unless the script runs 
      the command &#39;SkipAcquiringNavItem&#39;.&nbsp; If you stop the script with 
      &#39;End Loop' or 'STOP&#39; in the Camera and Script control panel, you can then resume 
      it with &#39;ResumeS&#39;, or you can end the script and go on to the primary task with 
      &#39;End Script&#39;. The program 
      keeps track of the script choice separately for tilt series and other primary 
      tasks.</P>
    <P><B>Primary Task</B></P>
    <P><B>Acquire map image </B>- The image file must already be opened before starting 
      the operation, unless a new file is set to be opened when the first item is 
      acquired. As each area is acquired, it will be added as a map item with a label 
      based on the label of the point being acquired (e.g., 12-A for point 12). The 
      original point will no longer be marked for acquisition and it will no longer 
      be drawn, to reduce clutter. Once the acquisition is finished, you could delete 
      the original points.</P>
    <P><B>Just acquire and save image</B> - Again, the image file must be open before 
      starting unless a file is set to be opened on the first item. This option is 
      useful if you do not need to make maps of your acquired images.&nbsp; For both 
      this option and the previous one, buttons in the Camera and Script control panel 
      allow you to stop the acquisition immediately (&#39;STOP&#39;), end it after the current 
      item is complete (&#39;End Nav&#39;), or pause the acquisition after the current item is 
      complete to allow some intervention (&#39;PauseN&#39;).&nbsp; Once acquisition is 
      paused, it can be resumed on the next item with &#39;ResumeN&#39; or ended immediately 
      with &#39;End Nav&#39;.</P>
    <P><B>Run script</B> - Select the script to run by its number or name. When the script completes, 
      the Navigator will go on to the next item. If it 
      stops with an error that cannot be resumed from, the Navigator acquisition will 
      also stop, unless the script includes the command &#39;NoMessageBoxOnError&#39;, in 
      which case the Navigator will go on to the next item.&nbsp; If there is an error that can be resumed from, or if you stop 
      the script with 'End Loop' or 'STOP' and it is then resumable, then the Navigator 
      will not go on to the next item and the status bar will show 'STOPPED NAV 
      SCRIPT'. At this point you can do several things: 1) Resume the script with 
      &#39;ResumeS&#39;; 2) abandon 
      this script and go on to the next item by using 'End Script'; 3) terminate the 
      acquisition after this item is completed or abandoned by pressing &#39;End Nav&#39; or by selecting 'End Acquire' in the Navigator menu; 
      or 4) end the acquisition immediately by pressing &#39;End All&#39;, which avoids having 
      to remember to press &#39;End Nav&#39; before &#39;End Script&#39;.&nbsp; The Camera and Script 
      control panel will also include a button &#39;PauseN&#39; for pausing acquisition after 
      the current item is completed.&nbsp; Once paused, acquisition can be resumed 
      with the &#39;ResumeN&#39; button or ended immediately with &#39;End Nav&#39;.</P>
    <P><B>Acquire tilt series</B> - All parameters and file properties should already 
      be set up when you go to start the series.&nbsp; Once a tilt series is started, 
      the regular tilt series control buttons in the Camera and Script control panel 
      function just as they do for tilt series started manually to allow stopping, 
      resuming, and stepping through the series.&nbsp; However, there is also an &#39;End 
      Nav&#39; button to stop Navigator acquisition after the current series is completed.&nbsp; 
      When the tilt series is stopped, an &#39;End TS&#39; button can be used to end the tilt 
      series and go on to the next.&nbsp; Press &#39;EndNav&#39; before &#39;End TS&#39; to terminate 
      all acquisition.</P>
    <P><b>Other Options</b></P>
    <P><B>Run script after </B>- This task can be run after all kinds 
      of 
      primary tasks.&nbsp; If you stop the script with 
      &#39;End Loop' or 'STOP&#39; in the Camera and Script control panel, you can then resume 
      it with &#39;ResumeS&#39;, or you can end the script and go on to the next item with 
      &#39;End Script&#39;. The program 
      keeps track of the script choice separately for tilt series and other primary 
      tasks.</P>
    <P><b>Do subset from index</b></P>
    <P>Select this option to acquire from a subset of items.&nbsp; Enter the item 
      index at which to start and end in the two text boxes.&nbsp; If there are no 
      items within the subset marked for acquisition and compatible with the selected 
      primary task, it will switch the primary task between tilt series and a non-tilt 
      series selection.&nbsp; When a subset is done, only the information stored for 
      items in that subset is accessed during that run.&nbsp; Specifically, files set to be opened and states to be set on 
      items before the subset will not be available.&nbsp; Thus, if file-opening 
      through the Navigator is needed, it must be done on the first item of the 
      subset.&nbsp; If tilt series are being done and a state needs to be set, it 
      should be done on the first item as well.</P>
    <P>The subset selection is reset after every run.&nbsp; However, if you close this 
      dialog with <b>Postpone</b>, the subset setting is saved.&nbsp; It will reappear 
      when you reopen the dialog and will apply if the acquisition is started from a 
      script command.</P>
    <P><b>Skip initial stage move</b></P>
    <P>Select this option to suppress the initial stage move to the area, which is 
      redundant when Realign to Item is going to be run.&nbsp; Several conditions must 
      be satisfied in order for the move to be skipped; if they are not, the option is 
      disabled and it has no effect if is already selected.&nbsp; When the primary 
      task is other than to run a script, it is disabled when <b>Realign to item</b> is not selected, and also when <b>Rough 
      eucentricity</b> is selected, because it would make no sense to do rough 
      eucentricity before the stage move.&nbsp; If <b>Autocenter beam</b> is selected,&nbsp; 
      the stage move will not be skipped on the first item, to ensure that there is a 
      usable area being viewed. </P>
    <P>If the primary task is to run a script, this option is available even when <b>
      Realign to item</b> is not selected.&nbsp; In such a case, the program just 
      assumes that the script will run Realign to Item or otherwise move the stage, 
      and it will issue warnings that it is relying on this.&nbsp; However, it will 
      not skip the move (and this option will be disabled) if <b>Cook specimen</b>, <b>
      Fine eucentricity</b>, or <b>Autofocus</b> is selected without <b>Realign to 
      item</b>, because those operations can only be done after moving to the item.</P>
    <P><b>Skip Z moves in initial move and Realign</b></P>
    <P>Select this option to leave the Z height unchanged in the initial stage move to 
      the item, and in Realign to Item if it is run.&nbsp; Otherwise, the Z height 
      will be set to the Z value of the item in the initial move, and to the Z value 
      of the first map used for aligning in ReAlign to Item unless <b>Rough 
      eucentricity</b> was selected as an initial action.&nbsp; This option would be 
      useful if the Z heights of the items are not correct, yet Z height is 
      approximately the same from one point to another.</P>
    <P><B>Restore scope state after aligning to item</B></P>
    <P>This option is enabled when you select 'Realign to item' as an initial task and 
      are running a script. If it is checked, then the current magnification and beam 
      settings will be restored after running 'Realign to item'. Usually, this is 
      appropriate, which is why it happens by default when making maps or taking 
      images. However, if you are realigning to a high-magnification map embedded in 
      a medium magnification map, then you could turn off this option if the beam and 
      magnification were already carefully adjusted before acquiring the 
      high-magnification map. That way, you would not have to readjust these settings 
      before starting the acquisition, and you would be protected against the scope 
      being in an undesirable state before starting a particular realign operation.</P>
    <P><B>Close column/gun valves at end</B></P>
    <P>If this option is available, you can set it to have the column or gun valve 
      closed at the end of the set of acquisitions. On a JEOL without a FEG, this 
      option can be used to turn the filament off instead.
    </P>
    <P><B>Send email at end</B></P>
    <P>If this option is enabled, you can select it to have an email sent to the 
      address entered with <A HREF="menu_tilt_series.htm#hid_tiltseries_setaddress">Set 
        Email Address</A> in the Tilt Series menu when the acquisition finishes. An 
      email will be sent if the acquisition stops with an error, but not if you stop 
      it yourself. For this option to be enabled, an SMTP server and address to mail 
      from must be specified in the SerialEM properties file.&nbsp; The program keeps 
      track of this option setting separately for tilt series and other kinds of 
      primary tasks.</P>
    <P><b>GO - Postpone - Cancel</b></P>
    <P><b>GO</b> starts the acquisition with the selected parameters.&nbsp; <b>
      Postpone</b> closes the dialog but saves the parameters, which is useful if 
      acquisition is started subsequently with the StartNavAcquireAtEnd script 
      command.&nbsp; <b>Cancel</b> closes the dialog and discards any changes in 
      parameters.</P>
