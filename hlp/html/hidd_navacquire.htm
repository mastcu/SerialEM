      <em><strong>Introduction</strong></em></P>
    <P><em>Actions and Tasks</em> - This dialog opens when the 'Navigator-Acquire at Items' menu item is selected
      and lets you control what operations are done at a series of Navigator items
      marked as 'Acquire' or 'Tilt Series'. These operations are of two kinds: the
      &quot;Primary Action&quot; performed to acquire images, and &quot;other tasks&quot;, optional steps
      to prepare for that acquisition.&nbsp; For items marked as 'Acquire', the
      primary actions available are to take and save an image, optionally making it a 
      Navigator map; acquire with the Multiple Records procedure; or run a script at each point. If there are only items marked as
      'Acquire', the Tilt Series option is unavailable; if there are only items
      marked as 'Tilt Series', the other actions are unavailable. If there are both
      kinds of items marked, the dialog will open with the Tilt series option
      selected but the other options available; however, the selected action will be
      taken only on the appropriate kind of item ('Acquire' or 'Tilt Series') and
      items of the other kind will be skipped.
    </P>
    <P><em>A unique non-modal dialog</em> - This dialog is non-modal, like various others that can stay open indefinitely,
      but unlike them, most operations are disabled because the program is considered
      to be busy doing a task when this dialog is open.&nbsp; This restriction is
      primarily to avoid changes in the Navigator data while the program is poised to
      start acquisition.&nbsp; Selected operations like taking images, loading a map,
      and opening, closing, and switching files are allowed;
      more may be allowed upon request.</P>
    <P><em>Operation control after starting</em> - Control of the tilt series or script acquisition after it is started is complex
      because it involves two levels of activity: the Navigator acquisition and the
      operation being run.&nbsp; Buttons in the Camera and Script control panel will
      be modified and enabled to allow control at both of these levels.&nbsp; The
      effect of these buttons is described for each action in the <b>Primary Action</b>
      section below.</P>
    <P><em>Acquisition parameter sets</em> - Because the acquisition of maps for target selection typically requires fewer
      operations and simpler parameter settings than actual data collection, the
      dialog allows you to maintain two sets of parameters.&nbsp; You can switch
      between them at any time with the <strong>Mapping</strong> and <strong>Final
      Data</strong> buttons at the top.&nbsp; The dialog works with a local copy of
      both sets, so <strong>Cancel</strong> will discard changes in both sets of
      parameters. All parameters are saved in your settings file.&nbsp; If you want to
      access more sets of parameters easily, without having to keep them in separate
      settings files, you can use the <strong>Save Parameters to File</strong> button
      at the bottom to save just the parameters in the currently selected set to a
      file, or <strong>Read in Parameters</strong> to load saved parameters into the
      currently selected set.</P>
    <P><em>Ordering of tasks - </em>This dialog allows the order of the associated
      tasks to be changed as desired, with some restrictions, including the ability to
      run tasks after the primary action.&nbsp; The order that they are listed in the
      column on the right, from top to bottom, is the order in which they will be run.</P>
    <P><em>Intelligent stage movement</em> - The program moves the stage only when
      necessary.&nbsp; The primary action has to be done at the location of the item
      being acquired, but some other tasks can be done elsewhere, such as on the
      carbon film or in an area allowed to have higher doses.&nbsp; If you set up one
      or more tasks to be done at another location, the program will move to that
      location for those tasks and will move to the current item&#39;s location for most
      other tasks and for the primary action.&nbsp; The exceptions are Manage
      Dewars/Vacuum, Flash FEG, and Update Dark Reference, which will be done wherever
      the stage is currently, and Realign to Item, which does one or more stage moves
      itself.&nbsp; It is most efficient if tasks done elsewhere are all done at the
      same location and are grouped together, before tasks that need to be done at the
      current item.</P>
    <P><em>Simplify the dialog</em> - The dialog has three features that allow you to
      simplify it and focus on selected settings.&nbsp; Unselected options on the left
      can be hidden; tasks not selected for running can be hidden; and the group box
      with controls for when and where a selected task will run can be closed up by
      &#39;unselecting&#39; the selected task.&nbsp; These features should be especially
      useful for mapping where parameter choices may be much simpler.</P>
    <P><A NAME="primaryAction"></A>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><B><em>Primary Action</em></B></P>
    <P><B>Acquire and save image or montage </B>- When this option is selected, turn 
      on the <strong>Make Navigator map</strong> checkbox to make a map from each image or montage. </P>
    <ul>
      <li><em>When making a map</em>, the image file must already be opened before starting
      the operation, unless a new file is set to be opened when the first item is
      acquired. As each area is acquired, it will be added as a map item with a label
      based on the label of the point being acquired (e.g., 12-A for point 12). The
      original point will no longer be marked for acquisition and it will no longer
      be drawn, to reduce clutter. Once the acquisition is finished, you could delete
      the original points.&nbsp; </li>
      <li><em>When not making a map</em>, such as for high quality data acquisition, the image file must 
        again be open before
      starting unless either a file is set to be opened on the first item, or the option
        <strong>Skip saving to file</strong> is selected below. </li>
      <li><em>In either case</em>, buttons in the Camera and Script control panel
      allow you to stop the acquisition immediately (&#39;STOP&#39;), end it after the current
      item is complete (&#39;End Nav&#39;), or pause the acquisition after the current item is
      complete to allow some intervention (&#39;PauseN&#39;).&nbsp; Once acquisition is
      paused, it can be resumed on the next item with &#39;ResumeN&#39; or ended immediately
      with &#39;End Nav&#39;.</li>
    </ul>
    <P><strong>Acquire multiple Records</strong> - The parameters set in the
      <a href="hidd_multi_shot_setup.htm">Multiple Record Setup dialog</a> are applied
      in this acquisition routine and take precedence over some similar parameters
      here, which are disabled.&nbsp; Specifically, the choice of whether to save
      images in that dialog governs saving, not the option to skip saving here, and
      the setting there for adjusting beam tllt and astigmatism for image shift
      determines whether that is done.&nbsp; If saving is being done, the file must be
      opened already or a file must be set to open on the first item.</P>
    <P><B>Acquire tilt series</B> - All parameters and file properties should already
      be set up when you go to start the series.&nbsp; Once a tilt series is started,
      the regular tilt series control buttons in the Camera and Script control panel
      function just as they do for tilt series started manually to allow stopping,
      resuming, and stepping through the series.&nbsp; However, there is also an &#39;End
      Nav&#39; button to stop Navigator acquisition after the current series is completed.&nbsp;
      When the tilt series is stopped, an &#39;End TS&#39; button can be used to end the tilt
      series and go on to the next.&nbsp; Press &#39;EndNav&#39; before &#39;End TS&#39; to terminate
      all acquisition.</P>
    <P><B>Run script</B> - Select the script to run by its number or name. When the script completes,
      the Navigator will go on to the next item. If it
      stops with an error that cannot be resumed from, the Navigator acquisition will
      also stop, unless the script includes the command &#39;NoMessageBoxOnError&#39;, in
      which case the Navigator will go on to the next item.&nbsp; If there is an error that can be resumed from, or if you stop
      the script with 'End Loop' or 'STOP' and it is then resumable, then the Navigator
      will not go on to the next item and the status bar will show 'STOPPED NAV
      SCRIPT'. At this point you can do several things: 1) Resume the script with
      &#39;ResumeS&#39;; 2) abandon
      this script and go on to the next item by using 'End Script'; 3) terminate the
      acquisition after this item is completed or abandoned by pressing &#39;End Nav&#39; or by selecting 'End Acquire' in the Navigator menu;
      or 4) end the acquisition immediately by pressing &#39;End All&#39;, which avoids having
      to remember to press &#39;End Nav&#39; before &#39;End Script&#39;.&nbsp; The Camera and Script
      control panel will also include a button &#39;PauseN&#39; for pausing acquisition after
      the current item is completed.&nbsp; Once paused, acquisition can be resumed
      with the &#39;ResumeN&#39; button or ended immediately with &#39;End Nav&#39;.</P>
    <P><A NAME="primaryOptions"></A></P>
    <P><b><em>Primary Action-Related Options</em></b></P>
    <P><strong>Cycle defocus target from X to Y um in N steps</strong></P>
    <P>Select this option to change the defocus target systematically for each item,
      cycling repeatedly from the value in the <strong>from</strong> box to the
      <strong>to</strong> box in the number of steps selected with the spinner.&nbsp;
      The number of different targets is the number of the steps plus one; e.g., if it
      is set to cycle from -2 to -1 micron in 5 steps, it will set the target to -2.0,
      -1.8, -1.6, -1.4, -1.2, and -1.0.&nbsp; Underfocus is negative as usual.&nbsp;
      This target applies to all autofocusing done, either with the Autofocus task in
      the task list, when running tilt series, when waiting for drift with autofocus
      runs, or when running a script.&nbsp; Hence the option is enabled in all those
      cases.</P>
    <P><strong>Adjust beam tilt &amp; astig for image shift</strong></P>
    <P>This option is enabled when you are saving images or maps, if you have calibrated the beam tilt needed for
      coma-free alignment as a function of image shift with
      <a href="menu_calibration.htm#hid_focustuning_comavs">Coma vs. Image Shift</a>
      in the Calibration - Focus &amp; Tuning submenu. The program wiil adjust beam tilt,
      and astigmatism if that is calibrated too, for any image shift present just
      before taking the Record image.&nbsp; If you are taking multiple Records, the
      option is disabled because the corresponding setting in the
      <a href="hidd_multi_shot_setup.htm">Multiple Record Setup dialog</a> applies
      instead, and that routine adjusts for the starting image shift.</P>
    <P><strong>Do early return with sum of N frames</strong></P>
    <P>This option appears if there is a K2 or K3 camera and allows the program to
      resume some operations as soon as possible after starting a frame-saving
      acquisition.&nbsp; The SerialEMCCD plugin will return control to SerialEM before
      the saving is finished, and return either an image with the given number of
      frames if a positive number is entered in the text box, no image if 0 is
      entered, or a sum of all the frames if -1 is entered. </P>
    <P><strong>Acquire non-montage images in Low Dose with</strong></P>
    <P>This set of radio buttons lets you take single images in Low Dose mode with 
      either the View or Search area, instead of just the Record area, just as you can 
      when montaging.&nbsp; They are enabled and have an effect only when the primary 
      action is to acquire images, and when not montaging.</P>
    <P><strong>Skip saving to file</strong></P>
    <P>This option is enabled when just acquiring images and allows you to skip saving
      to a file, which might be desired when saving frames.</P>
    <P><A NAME="taskOptions"></A>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><b><em>Options for Other Tasks</em></b></P>
    <P><b>Do hybrid Realign to Item/Align to Template</b></P>
    <P>This option is enabled when you have set the Align to Template task to run on
      every item and also set Realign to Item to run on at least some of the items.&nbsp;
      When the Realign to Item routine is run, it will test whether it can skip the
      first round of alignment to the center of the map or of a map frame and rely on
      a recent alignment to that position.&nbsp; If not, it will proceed with its full
      operation.&nbsp; If it can skip the first round, it will compute the position of
      the item based on the stored results of the first round, move to that location,
      and end without taking or aligning any images.&nbsp; This should largely
      compensate for accumulated errors in positioning and make the position be close
      enough so that alignment to the template can work reliably.&nbsp; This approach
      <em>will not work</em> if the spacing between target features is too small and
      the stage movement is sloppy even with backlash or has periodic variability in
      its positioning (i.e., older Tecnai compustages).&nbsp; However, for typical
      center-to-center spacing between holes in a carbon film, the hybrid approach may
      well worlk with such stages.</P>
    <P><b>Relax stage after final movement</b></P>
    <P>Select this option to move the stage by a small amount opposite to the
      direction of the last movement, provided that the stage is in a known backlash
      state.&nbsp; This operation has been found to reduce stage drift in some
      microscopes but could be counterproductive elsewhere.&nbsp; You should use it
      only if it has been verified that drift does indeed settle faster, using the
      &#39;TestRelaxingStage&#39; script command.</P>
    <P><b>Skip Z moves in initial move and Realign</b></P>
    <P>Select this option to leave the Z height unchanged in the stage move to
      the item&#39;s location, and in Realign to Item if it is run.&nbsp; Otherwise, the Z height
      will be set to the Z value of the item in the initial move, and to the Z value
      of the first map used for aligning in Realign to Item unless one of the three
      eucentricity routines was run prior to the these stage moves.&nbsp; This option
      would be useful if the Z heights of the items are not correct and eucentricity
      is run on only a subset of points, provided that Z height is approximately the
      same from one point to another between runs of a eucentricity routine.</P>
    <P><b>Skip stage move to item if possible</b></P>
    <P>This option is disabled and its setting has no effect except when a script is 
      run before or as the primary action.&nbsp; Select this option to suppress a 
      stage move to the area prior to the primary action, if one still seems necessary 
      (i.e., if no task was done that required being at the area already).&nbsp; In 
      the cases where the option is enabled, the program is willing to
      rely on one script or the other having moved to the area, either with an
      explicit stage move or with Realign to Item.&nbsp; </P>
    <P><A NAME="generalOptions"></A>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><em><strong>General Options</strong></em></P>
    <P><b>Do subset from index</b></P>
    <P>Select this option to acquire from a subset of items.&nbsp; Enter the item
      index at which to start and end in the two text boxes.&nbsp; If there are no
      items within the subset marked for acquisition and compatible with the selected
      primary task, it will switch the primary task between tilt series and a non-tilt
      series selection.&nbsp; When a subset is done, only the information stored for
      items in that subset is accessed during that run.&nbsp; Specifically, files set to be opened and states to be set on
      items before the subset will not be available.&nbsp; Thus, if file-opening
      through the Navigator is needed, it must be done on the first item of the
      subset.&nbsp; If tilt series are being done and a state needs to be set, it
      should be done on the first item as well.</P>
    <P>The subset selection is reset after every run.&nbsp; However, if you close this
      dialog with <b>Postpone</b>, the subset setting is saved.&nbsp; It will reappear
      when you reopen the dialog and will apply if the acquisition is started from a
      script command.</P>
    <P><b>No message box when errors occur</b></P>
    <P>Selecting this option has two effects: message boxes that would block
      unattended operation are converted to messages in the log, and the underlying
      failures are either ignored or cause the program to skip the current item and
      move on to the next.&nbsp; Without the option set, a message box will pop up and
      the acquisition will be stopped.</P>
    <P><B>Close column/gun valves at end</B></P>
    <P>If this option is available, you can set it to have the column or gun valve
      closed at the end of the set of acquisitions. On a JEOL without a FEG, this
      option can be used to turn the filament off instead.
    </P>
    <P><B>Send email at end</B></P>
    <P>If this option is enabled, you can select it to have an email sent to the
      address entered with <A HREF="menu_tilt_series.htm#hid_tiltseries_setaddress">Set
        Email Address</A> in the Tilt Series menu when the acquisition finishes. An
      email will be sent if the acquisition stops with an error, but not if you stop
      it yourself. For this option to be enabled, an SMTP server and address to mail
      from must be specified in the SerialEM properties file.&nbsp; The program keeps
      track of this option setting separately for tilt series and other kinds of
      primary tasks.</P>
    <P><strong>Hide unselected options</strong></P>
    <P>This option allows you to simplify the left side of the dialog by hiding all
      options that are not checked.&nbsp; However, if you uncheck an option when
      hiding is turned on, it will stay visible to make it easier for you to turn it
      back on.&nbsp; Toggle the option off and back on to hide any newly unselected
      options.</P>
    <P><A NAME="taskList"></A></P>
    <P><strong><em>Tasks Before and After Primary Action</em></strong></P>
    <P>This section has a series of lines corresponding to optional steps that can be run
      on some or all items. Their order from top to bottom corresponds to the order in
      which they will be run, with a line &#39;Primary Action Runs Here&#39; showing where
      that occurs in the sequence.&nbsp; Each line has 4 elements:</P>
    <P><em>The checkbox</em> at the left selects whether the task is run.</P>
    <P><em>The button with the task name</em> selects the task as the one whose
      parameters are shown in the &#39;General controls for task&#39; group box below.&nbsp;
      It is possible to close up this group box by pressing the selected button again,
      so that no button is selected.&nbsp; </P>
    <P><em>A text string</em> to the right of the button summarizes when the task is
      set to be run.</P>
    <P><em>A </em><strong><em>Setup</em></strong><em> button</em> is also present for
      most tasks.&nbsp; For some, this button will open the same setup dialog that can
      be opened from a menu entry in the Tasks or Navigator menu.&nbsp; For others, it
      will either invoke a parameter setting sequence available from another menu
      item, or bring up a small dialog with a parameter choice.</P>
    <P>The tasks will now be described in their default order:</P>
    <P><strong>Manage Dewars/Vacuum</strong> (or<strong> Manage Nitrogen</strong> on
      JEOL) - This task can be used to pause acquisition when a disturbing event
      occurs on the microscope, or to initiate such an event periodically.&nbsp; The
      events are the running of vacuum pumps on Thermo/FEI scopes, and the filling of
      nitrogen dewar(s) filling on various scopes.&nbsp; The <strong>Setup</strong>
      button opens the <a href="hidd_manage_dewars.htm">Dewar and Vacuum Management</a>
      dialog.&nbsp; (In order for the nitrogen filling options to appear in that 
      dialog on non-Krios Thermo/FEI scopes, the property entry &#39;DewarVacCapabilities&#39; 
      is needed).&nbsp; The timing for running operations is all controlled by the
      management procedure itself, so this task should be run on every item.</P>
    <P><strong>Flash FEG -</strong> This task can be used to flash a cold FEG.&nbsp;
      For Thermo/FEI scopes, the scripting interface can tell whether flashing is advised,
      and it is reasonable to flash only when advised.&nbsp; Thus, the task can be run
      frequently, even on every item.&nbsp; There is a <strong>Setup</strong> button
      to pop up a dialog for you to choose whether to do high-temperature flashes if
      those are advised, or only low-temperature flashes when they are advised.&nbsp;
      For JEOL scopes, there is no <strong>Setup</strong> button, and the task will
      flash the FEG unconditionally when it is run, so it is important to specify an
      appropriate interval at which it should be flashed.</P>
    <P><strong>Coma-free Alignment - </strong>This task will run the coma-free
      alignment routine that uses CTF fitting.&nbsp; The <strong>Setup</strong> button
      will run the Focus menu <a href="#hid_focus_set_ctf_coma_bt">Set CTF Coma-free Params</A>
      command then the <a href="#hid_focus_setctfacquireparams">Set CTF Acquire Params</A>
      command; you can cancel out at any point in the long series of entry boxes.</P>
    <P><strong>Astigmatism -</strong> This task will run one of the two astigmatism
      routines.&nbsp; The <strong>Setup</strong> button will first pop up a dialog for
      you to choose whether to use fitting to the CTF or analysis of beam-tilted image
      displacements (BTID).&nbsp; For CTF fitting, it then runs the Focus menu <a href="#hid_focus_setctfacquireparams">Set CTF Acquire Params</A>
      command.&nbsp; For the BTID method, it with run the Focus menu <a href="#hid_focus_setastigbeamtilt">Set BTID Astig Beam Tilt</a>
      command.&nbsp; Yes, all these coma and astigmatism parameters should be on a
      single dialog...</P>
    <P><strong>Condition Phase Plate -</strong> This task will run the phase plate
      conditioning routine after moving the phase plate to a new area.&nbsp; The
      <strong>Setup</strong>
      button opens the <A HREF="hidd_vpp_expose_setup.htm">Phase Plate Conditioning Setup</A>
      dialog box, but the button to start the routine from that dialog is disabled.&nbsp;
      If the <strong>Run at nearest item with label or note </strong>option in the
      General Controls section is set for this task, it will be run at the indicated
      item, regardless of the setting for where to run it in the Setup dialog.&nbsp;
      However, if that option is not checked here, it will be run at the place
      indicated in the Setup dialog.</P>
    <P><strong>Update Dark Reference -</strong> This task will acquire a new dark
      reference for a DE camera based on the current Record parameters, or update the hardware dark reference for a K2/K3
      camera.&nbsp;&nbsp; Set the time interval for doing so in the <strong>General
      controls</strong> group box.&nbsp; For a DE camera, there is a <strong>Setup</strong>
      button which will bring open the <a href="hidd_de_reference.htm">Direct Electron Server Reference Maker dialog</a>
      in a restricted mode that has settings based on the current Record acquisition parameters.
    </P>
    <P><strong>Refine ZLP -</strong> This task runs the Refine ZLP routine started by
      the button in the <a href="hidd_filtercontrol.htm">Filter Control panel</a>.</P>
    <P><B>Rough Eucentricity - </B>Either the Rough Eucentricity or the Eucentricity
      by Focus task should be selected if it
      is necessary that the specimen be eucentric and if the Z height might be off by
      more than 10 microns. Neither one retains alignment to a specimen position so
      they should be run prior to 'Realign to Item' or 'Align toTemplate'.&nbsp; When
      you change the selected parameter set or close this dialog with <strong>GO</strong>
      or <strong>Postpone</strong>, the program will check whether operations are not
      in this order and ask you to confirm that you want to proceed if so.&nbsp; The
      Rough Eucentricity task uses tilting to set Z to the eucentric point.</P>
    <P><strong>Eucentricity by Focus -</strong> This task will set the Z height to
      either the eucentric point or to another chosen height relative to eucentricity
      by setting a standard focus value then adjusting Z height so that measured
      defocus matches the value measured previously for that standard focus value.&nbsp;
      This routine should be faster than Rough Eucentricity and may be more accurate,
      but it requires a calibration done in the <a href="hidd_z_by_g_setup.htm">Eucentricity by Focus Setup dialog</a>,
      which the <strong>Setup</strong> button opens.</P>
    <P><B>Autocenter Beam</B> - This task will condense the beam and take a picture to
      determine how to recenter it. Beam autocentering must already be set up for the
      current magnification in the <A HREF="hidd_autocensetup.htm">Beam Autocentering
        Setup dialog box</A>.
    </P>
    <P><B>Realign to Item - </B>This task will realign to a selected specimen feature,
      but requires that the item be located within a sufficiently large
      medium-magnification map, as described in <A HREF="menu_navigator.htm#hid_navigator_aligntoitem">
        Realign to Item</A>.&nbsp; If
      eucentricity has <i>not</i> been set yet
      during the acquire sequence, then the realign operation will be done at the Z
      height of the item being aligned to.&nbsp; However, if eucentricity <em>has</em> 
      been run, then
      the Z height found during that operation is retained for the realign operation.&nbsp;
      Thus, a new map acquired at this position will have the right Z height.&nbsp;
      There will be some error in realigning to the map because of the Z height
      difference.&nbsp; This error will be recorded for the new map and taken into
      account when realigning to this pair of maps in the future.&nbsp; The <strong>
      Setup</strong> button opens the lower part of the <a href="hidd_navrealign.htm">Navigator Align Setup</a>
        dialog, where there are options for resetting image shift after the alignment
      operation.&nbsp; This task will restore microscope state afterwards when not in 
      Low Dose mode, but not when in Low Dose mode.&nbsp; There used to be an option 
      to control whether state was restored when the primary action was a script, but 
      it was eliminated because this default behavior seems appropriate.&nbsp; If for 
      some reason it is not, incorporate the Relaign To Item into the script instead.</P>
    <P><B>Cook specimen</B> - This task will stabilize the specimen by pre-exposing it
      for a certain amount of time or to achieve a certain dose. The parameters for
      this operation must already be set up in the <A HREF="hidd_cooksetup.htm">Specimen
        Cooking Setup dialog box</A>.&nbsp; This operation maintains alignment to the
      specimen position.</P>
    <P><B>Fine Eucentricity -</B> This task can be selected if eucentricity needs to be
      found with the highest accuracy, but the Z height should be within 10 microns
      of eucentric before running this task. If either 'Realign to Item' or 'Align to
      Template' has also been run for this items,
      the task is run in a way that maintains alignment to the specimen position (the <A HREF="menu_tasks.htm#hid_tasks_finerealign">
        Refine &amp; Realign command</A>).</P>
    <P><strong>Align to Template -</strong> This task will align to a map containing a
      template image, such as a cropped image of one hole in the carbon film.&nbsp;
      The <strong>Setup</strong> button opens the full <a href="hidd_navrealign.htm">Navigator Align Setup</a>
        dialog, where the label of the template map and the maximum shift for the
      alignment can be set.&nbsp; Image shift can also be reset after this alignment.&nbsp;
      If both Realign to Item and this task are being run and image shift is being
      reset, it will be reset only after the Align to Template.&nbsp; If you are
      primarily relying on Align to Template for positioning, consider selecting the
      option for the hybrid Realign to Item/Align to Template approach explained
      above.&nbsp; If the routine does not find a shitf within the limit and the
      <strong>No message box on error</strong> option is selected, the Navigator will
      skip this item and go on to the next.</P>
    <P><B>Autofocus -</B> Select this option to run the autofocus routine prior to the
      main action.&nbsp; The <strong>Setup</strong> button opens an popup box for you
      to enter the maximum change in focus to be allowed.&nbsp; When that maximum is
      exceeded, or if the autofocus aborts due to inconsistent changes, the Navigator
      will skip this item and go on to the next.</P>
    <P><strong>Wait for Drift -</strong> This task will wait for drift to settle to a
      desired level, using parameters set in the <A HREF="hidd_driftwaitsetup.htm">Wait for Drift Setup</A> dialog.&nbsp;
      If the operation fails and the <strong>No message box on error</strong> option
      is selected, the Navigator will skip this item and go on to the next.</P>
    <P><B>Run Script</B><strong> Before -</strong> This task is available for all kinds
      of
      primary actions.&nbsp; When the primary action is tilt series acquisition, the script
      should be used for quick operations such as opening secondary files; if extended
      tasks are performed, the script is responsible for maintaining alignment to the
      specimen position. Even if the script is stopped or fails to complete
      successfully, the program will go on to the primary action, unless the script runs
      the command &#39;SkipAcquiringNavItem&#39;.&nbsp; If you stop the script with
      &#39;End Loop' or 'STOP&#39; in the Camera and Script control panel, you can then resume
      it with &#39;ResumeS&#39;, or you can end the script and go on to the primary
      action with
      &#39;End Script&#39;. The program
      keeps track of this script choice separately for tilt series and other primary
      actions.</P>
    <P><B>Run Script After </B>- This task can be run after all kinds
      of
      primary actions.&nbsp; If you stop the script with
      &#39;End Loop' or 'STOP&#39; in the Camera and Script control panel, you can then resume
      it with &#39;ResumeS&#39;, or you can end the script and go on to the next item with
      &#39;End Script&#39;. The program
      keeps track of this script choice separately for tilt series and other primary
      actions.</P>
    <P><A NAME="taskControls"></A></P>
    <P><em><strong>General controls for selected task:</strong></em></P>
    <P><strong>How often to run task </strong>- radio button group</P>
    <P>These radio buttons provide several different ways to run a task periodically
      instead of at every item, the choice depends partly on how your points are
      divided into groups, e.g., one group versus multiple groups per grid square.</P>
    <P><strong>Every N items - </strong>Select this and set the number to 1 to run the
      task for every item, 2 for every other item, 10 for every tenth item, etc.</P>
    <P><strong>Only at start of group -</strong> Select this to run the task on the
      first item in a group.</P>
    <P><strong>Only at end of group -</strong> Select this to run the task on the last
      item in a group.</P>
    <P><strong>Every N minutes -</strong> Select this and specify a number of minutes
      (an integer) to run the task at intervals of that many minutes.</P>
    <P><strong>When moved &gt; X um -</strong> Select this and specify a distance in
      microns to run the task whenever the distance since the last place where it was
      run exceeds the given distance.&nbsp; This might be useful for a eucentricity
      task.</P>
    <P><strong>Position in sequence </strong>- button group</P>
    <P><strong>Move Up -</strong> Press this button to move the task up one step in
      the ordering.&nbsp; It is possible to move a task from after to before the
      primary action with this button; this will turn off the
      <strong>Run after Primary Action</strong> checkbox.</P>
    <P><strong>Move Down -</strong> Press this button to move the task down one step
      in the ordering.&nbsp; The button will be disabled when a task that is not 
      allowed to run after the primary action reaches the last position before the 
      primary action.&nbsp; For other tasks, it can be used to move the task from 
      before to after the action.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><strong>Run after Primary Action</strong></P>
    <P>Select this option to run the task after the primary action instead of before.&nbsp;
      It is disabled for tasks where doing so makes no sense.&nbsp; The line for the
      task will leap from one side of the Primary Action line to the other when this
      option is toggled.</P>
    <P><strong>Run at nearest item with label or note starting with</strong></P>
    <P>Select this option to run the task at a location different from that of the
      item for which it is being run.&nbsp; The location is that of a different
      Navigator item.&nbsp; Select whether to specify that other item by the note or
      label, and enter some text with which the note or label must start.&nbsp; The
      text matching is case-sensitive. There can be many such items, in which case
      the program will find and go to the nearest one.&nbsp; This capability is good
      for dose-intensive operations or ones that need to be done on the carbon film.&nbsp;
      For maximum efficiency, all such tasks should be done prior to ones that need to
      be done at the target location, and they should be done at the same location.
      This option to run elsewhere is disabled for tasks where it makes no sense.</P>

    <P><strong>Hide unused tasks</strong></P>
    <P>Select this option to hide the tasks that are not selected for running, to
      simplify the dialog and make it more evident what will be run.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      When it is turned off, all tasks will be shown again.&nbsp; When you turn off a
      task, it will not be hidden immediately so that it is easy to turn on again, but
      it will disappear if this option is toggled off and on again.</P>

      saved consist of all those adjusted on the dialog itself plus a few others set
      by small popup dialogs that open only from one of the task Setup buttons. </P>
    <P><strong>Read in Parameters</strong></P>
    <P>Press this button to read saved parameters in to replace the currenly selected

      still use <strong>Cancel</strong> to return to the previous parameters.</P>
    <P><b>GO - Postpone - Cancel</b></P>
    <P><b>GO</b> starts the acquisition with the selected parameters in the currently
      selected set.&nbsp; This button will be labeled Resume if the Navigator was
      paused during acquisition.&nbsp; <b>
      Postpone</b> closes the dialog but saves the parameters, which is useful if you
      need to open a file, or if
      acquisition is started subsequently with the StartNavAcquireAtEnd script
      command.&nbsp; <b>Cancel</b> closes the dialog and discards any changes in
      parameters.</P>
