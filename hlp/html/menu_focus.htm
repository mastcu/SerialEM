      <BR>
      <P><A NAME="hid_focus_measuredefocus"></A><B>Measure Defocus command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command is used to run the autofocus routine for measuring defocus, without
        changing to the target defocus. Upon completion, the program will inform you of
        the measured defocus and ask if you want to set the target defocus to this
        value. This procedure is typically used if one adjusts focus manually to give
        the desired image appearance, then measures defocus and uses the measured value
        to set the target.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_focus_autofocus"></A><B>Autofocus command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will run the autofocus routine to measure defocus and then change
        focus to achieve the target defocus. If the indicated change in focus is
        greater than a preset threshold, then the program will change focus by at most
        twice the threshold amount, and repeat the autofocus routine. This threshold is
        set with the Set Threshold command described below.</P>
    <P>In Low Mag, it will use the same procedure to measure defocus if there is an
      autofocus calibration in Low Mag; if not, it will set focus to a standard focus
      value for the current magnification if one has been defined.</P>
    <P>In STEM mode a completely different procedure is used, as described in the
      section on <b>Autofocus</b> in <a href="about_stem.htm">STEM Mode</a>, and the target for defocus is always 0.</P>
      <P>Shortcut Key:CTRL+G</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_focus_movecenter"></A><B>Move Center command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command can be used at high tilt to change the focus so as to move the
        visible center of focus by a desired amount. First click the left mouse button
        to set a display point at a place in the image with the desired focus. Then
        select this command. The center of the field in the next acquired image should
        be at the desired focus level.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_focus_checkautofocus"></A><B>Check Autofocus command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command can be used to assess how well autofocus will work. The program
        will measure defocus using the current parameters at the current defocus, and
        at +5 and -5 microns away from that defocus. It will then inform you of the
        measured defocus change as a fraction of the actual change in defocus in each
        direction. If these numbers are greater than 0.9, autofocusing will be fairly
        accurate even for relatively large changes. If the numbers are sufficiently
        large, autofocusing should work adequately during a tilt series; otherwise it
        will be unreliable.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_focus_reportshiftdrift"></A><B>Report Shift &amp; Drift command (Focus/Tune
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to run the routine for measuring defocus and receive a report
        of the beam tilt-induced image shift plus the shift due to drift, all in pixels
        (unbinned pixels are reported if the images were binned). Drift protection must
        be selected to get a meaningful estimate of drift.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_focus_reportonexisting"></A><B>Report on Existing command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to measure the beam tilt-induced image shift and the shift due
        to drift from pictures that are already in buffers A-C from a previous
        autofocusing operation. If drift protection is off, only the shift between
        pictures in buffers A and B will be reported.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_focus_showexistingcorr"></A><B>Show Existing Corr command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to display the autofocus cross-correlation from pictures that
        are already in buffers A-C from a previous autofocusing operation. The
        correlation will be placed in buffer A and existing images will be rolled up
        one buffer.</P>
    <P>In STEM mode, this command will probably fail to work right unless the property STEMFocusShowBestAtEnd
      is added to the Properties file and set to 0.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_focus_showexistingstretch"></A><B>Show Image Stretch command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to see the stretch that is used to compensate for specimen
      tilt above 5 degrees, for pictures that are already in buffers A-C from a
      previous autofocus operation.&nbsp; The second image of the autofocus series
      will be replaced with the stretched version and the original will be copied down
      two buffers if rolling is allowed into that buffer.&nbsp; If binning is being
      applied to direct detector images, the stretching occurs after binning, so the
      replaced image will be binned.&nbsp; The program also reports the matrix applied
      to do the stretch in the log.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_focus_settarget"></A><B>Set Target command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command is used to enter a specific target defocus for autofocusing. After
        the autofocus routine measures a defocus, it will change the focus setting so
        as to achieve this target level. Selecting this command brings up a dialog box
        for entering the number; the default value shown is the current target. Enter a
        defocus in microns.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_focus_setbeamtilt"></A><B>Set Beam Tilt command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command is used to set the beam tilt that is used for autofocusing, and 
        optionally a separate beam tilt for autofocusing in Low Magnification mode.
        Selecting this command brings up a dialog box with a default value equal to the
        current beam tilt value. The units are milliradians (mrad) for Thermo/FEI and 
        percent of full scale for other scopes.&nbsp; Then a second box opens to allow 
        you to enter a different value for LM mode, or 0 to use the same beam tilt as in 
        non-LM mode.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_focus_setoffset"></A><B>Set Offset command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set a focus offset that will be applied before any of the
        autofocusing operations invoked in the Focus menu. For example, if the offset
        is set to +5 &micro;m, then when you choose to measure defocus, the program will
        change defocus by +5 &micro;m, take pictures for measuring defocus, restore the
        defocus by -5 &micro;m, and subtract 5 &micro;m from the measured value to determine the
        current defocus. This option provides a way to autofocus to a target far from
        zero when the program is having difficulty autofocusing.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_focus_setthreshold"></A><B>Set Threshold command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set the thresholds for repeating the autofocus procedure
        after a large change in defocus, and for applying the logic that can abort
        autofocus when iterations give inconsistent results. The current value of the threshold
        for repeating autofocus is the
        default value shown in the first dialog box. Whenever autofocusing changes the focus
        level by more than this amount, the program will repeat the autofocus
        operation.&nbsp; Values less than 0.05 will disable this iterating.&nbsp; After entering this threshold, a second dialog box appears
        asking for the threshold for testing whether successive results are
        inconsistent.&nbsp; You can enter 0 to disable the tests for inconsistent
        autofocus.&nbsp; The testing will always be done for any non-zero value less
        than the threshold for repeating autofocus; values higher than the threshold for
        repeating will make the testing be skipped when changes are between the two
        threshold levels.&nbsp; The latter may be desirable when using very small
        thresholds for repeating.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_focus_set_tilt_direction"></A><B>Set Tilt Direction command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set the direction that the beam will be tilted during all
        autofocusing operations.&nbsp; Enter a number between 0 and 3, where 0
        corresponds to tilting with the X coil only, 1 tilts with equal deflections on
        the X and Y coils, 2 tilts with the Y coil only, and 3 tilts with a negative
        deflection on X for a positive one on Y.&nbsp; Using a number different than 0,
        which was the only direction available before SerialEM 3.4, will cause the image
        to shift in different directions, at 45 degree increments from the shift at
        direction 0.&nbsp; Focus calibrations are specific to the current direction, so
        the calibration must be done at each direction to be used for autofocusing.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_focus_set_ddd_min_binning"></A><B>Set Min Binning command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to
        set a minimum total binning to apply when correlating autofocus images from a
        direct detector, or from any other camera where SerialEMproperties.txt includes
        &#39;UseMinDDDFocusBinning 1&#39; in the properties for that camera.&nbsp; The autofocus routine does not apply any binning to the
        images that it correlates by default, but it is recommended that the Focus
        images themselves be taken with some binning to reduce the effects of fixed
        noise in the images.&nbsp; It can be difficult to take images with the needed
        binning with direct detectors because their high gain values make binned images
        saturate easily.&nbsp; Thus, this command allows one to process autofocus images
        obtained with lower binning as if they had been taken with higher binning.&nbsp;
        Enter the desired total binning.&nbsp; When autofocusing, the program either
        applies additional binning to reach the specified binning, or reduces the cutoff
        and rolloff of the high-frequency filter to achieve an equivalent effect, or a
        combination of the two.&nbsp; For example, if the total minimum binning is set
        to 4, unbinned images will be binned by 4 for correlating, images with binning 2
        will be binned by 2 again, and images with binning 3 will be correlated with the
        filter parameters multiplied by 0.75.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_focus_set_filter_cutoffs"></A><B>Test Filter Cutoffs command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to
        set the cutoff and rolloff parameters for the low and high frequency filters
        applied when correlating autofocus images.&nbsp; The &#39;Test&#39; in the name of the
        command refers to the fact that values are not retained between program
        sessions.&nbsp; If a filter change is needed, it should be set in the
        SerialEMproperties.txt file.&nbsp; First enter the frequency at which the
        high-frequency filter starts to cut off, in reciprocal pixels.&nbsp; Then enter
        the sigma value for the rolloff of the filter.&nbsp; In both cases, smaller
        numbers filter more.&nbsp; These parameters may need to be adjusted when there
        are severe problems with fixed noise in the correlation images.&nbsp; To change
        them in the properties file, add lines starting with &#39;FocusFilterRadius2&#39; and/or
        &#39;FocusFilterSigma2&#39;.&nbsp; The third property is the sigma for the low-frequency
        filter, an inverted Gaussian that is zero at zero frequency and rises to 1.&nbsp;
        Its property entry is &#39;FocusFilterSigma1&#39;, but the current default should be
        effective.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_focus_driftprotection"></A><B>Drift Protection command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to toggle between having two or three pictures taken for
        autofocusing. With three pictures, the program can separate shift due to drift
        from the beam tilt-induced image shift used to determine defocus. The measured
        defocus will thus be accurate if the drift is constant.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_focus_setabsoluteliimits"></A><B>Set Absolute Limits command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to set limits for the absolute focus that can be accessed
      during autofocusing.&nbsp; The main purpose of such limits would be to prevent
      failures in taking images due to the Falcon Dose Protector, but they might be
      useful in other situations.&nbsp; The first step is to set the microscope to
      eucentric focus, which you could do by pressing a Eucentric Focus button or by
      making the stage eucentric and focusing a specimen.&nbsp; After you confirm that
      the scope is at eucentric focus, the program asks you to enter the lower and
      upper limits for defocus relative to that point, in microns; these are assumed

    <P><A NAME="hid_focus_correctastigmatismwithffts"></A><B>Correct Astigmatism by CTF command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
    <p>This command will measure and correct astigmatism by fitting the CTF to Thon
      rings in an image.&nbsp; It is one of three operations run through the same
      routine, the others being the calibration of this correction and <a href="#hid_focus_coma_by_ctf">Coma-free alignment by CTF</A>.&nbsp;
      Here is a general introduction to the operation and use of this routine.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A NAME="autotuning_by_ctf"></A><i><b>Autotuning by CTF Fitting</b></i>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The CTF autotuning routines require images with Thon rings suitable for fitting
      with the Ctffind module.&nbsp; To get the best signal-to-noise ratio and the
      most accurate fitting, images need to have a long enough exposure and use the
      full camera area.&nbsp; They are taken with parameters generally derived from
      the Record parameters, but specific values, such as for exposure time and
      binning, can be set with the <a href="#hid_focus_setctfacquireparams">Set CTF Acquire Params</A>.&nbsp;
      For example, if your Record exposure time is set for a long acquisition for
      single-particle reconstruction, you should specify a shorter time for the CTF
      tuning images.</p>
    <p>The first step in the CTF tuning routine is to measure the current defocus,
      both to make sure that defocus is an acceptable range and to set the defocus
      range for CTF fitting.&nbsp; The routine will then run at the current defocus
      provided that it is within a range where the CTF fitting is expected to work.&nbsp;
      Defocus will be changed if necessary to avoid defocus values that are too low in
      astigmatic images, and so that the expected number of CTF rings will not be too
      low or too high.</p>
    <p>Defocus should be in the range of -1.0 to -2.5 microns, or more underfocused at
      lower magnifications (e.g., with a pixel size in the range of 1 nm or more).</p>
    <p>You should verify that the CTF fitting is reasonably accurate with the
      acquisition parameters and defocus being used by turning on
        <a href="menu_process.htm#hid_process_doctffindfitonclick">Do Ctffind On Click</a>
      and checking that the fits work when clicking, and that the defocus varies by
      only about 3-10 nm between successive images (e.g., for focus near -2 microns).&nbsp;
      Larger variations will occur at lower magnifications and higher defocus,
      situations where the lower accuracy of fitting may be acceptable.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>It is a good idea to open the side-by-side FFT display (see
        <a href="menu_process.htm#hid_process_side_by_side">Side by Side</a>)
      when you are first using these routines.&nbsp; When this window is open, the
      program will show the CTF fit for each image, taking an FFT if it is not being
      done automatically (i.e., with <a href="menu_process.htm#hid_process_automaticffts">Automatic Single FFTs</a>
      turned on).</p>
    <p>Fitting will be done with the slower 2D search, which may not be turned on when
      clicking in an image.&nbsp; If you see bad fits when running these routines, you
      should make sure the 2D search is enabled when clicking with the
        <a href="menu_process.htm#hid_process_setctffindoptions">Set Ctffind Options</a>
      command, and adjust parameters until fitting works when clicking in an image.</p>
    <p>If there are few Thon rings and they do not extend out very far, the fitting
      may fail because the resolution range for fitting is set too high.&nbsp; Two alternative
      solutions for this are to increase the limit on the maximum resolution for fitting
        with
        <a href="menu_process.htm#hid_process_setctffindoptions">Set Ctffind Options</a> or  to bin the images so that the Thon rings extend
      to a higher frequency (in reciprocal pixels) in the image.</p>
    <p>The CTF autotuning routines will zero out the image shift, giving a zero
      reading of IS or PLA in the Microscope Status panel.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Correcting Astigmatism by CTF Fitting</b></i>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The astigmatism correction routine will measure defocus, take a single image,
      and correct the astigmatism.&nbsp; If the change in stigmators is above a
      threshold, it will take another image and refine the correction.&nbsp; You can
      check the result by taking an image and clicking near the first zero with
        <a href="menu_process.htm#hid_process_doctffindfitonclick">Do Ctffind On Click</a>
      enabled.</p>
    <p>Technically, if you are going to correct coma as well, you should correct that
      first, then astigmatism. In practice, this matters only if the the beam tilt
      misalignment is substantial.&nbsp; In that case, some of the astigmatism in the
      image may be due to beam tilt, and simply making the image have no astigmatism
      will leave the stigmators at the wrong setting. The coma-free alignment routine
      is insensitive to astigmatism, so it will fix the beam tilt and leave the
      astigmatism in the image that does need to be corrected with stigmators.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Which Astigmatism Method to Use</i></b></p>
    <p>The CTF-based method has several advantages: it is based on a direct
      measurement of astigmatism, it is insensitive to drift, it does not require beam
      tilt, and it uses on-axis images in Low Dose mode.&nbsp; It is inherently more
      accurate at higher magnifications.&nbsp; Both methods should be calibrated at
      higher magnification but can work at lower ones (e.g., ~1 nm pixel size).&nbsp;
      The big disadvantage of the CTF-based method is that it requires images with
      Thon rings.&nbsp; There is thus still a role for the BTID-base method at lower
      magnifications and when working with stained, embedded samples, which are
      usually imaged near focus and rarely give Thon rings.</p>
    <P><A NAME="hid_focus_coma_by_ctf"></A><B>Coma-free Alignment by CTF command (Focus/Tune menu)</B></P>
    <p>Use this command to measure and correct for beam-tilt misalignment (coma) by
      fitting a CTF to the Thon rings in images.&nbsp; The program will take 5 images,
      one with no beam tilt and the others with beam tilt in the plus and minus X and
      Y directions.&nbsp; It is also possible to take a full array of images, 8 with
      beam tilt and 2 without.&nbsp; The defocus changes at various angles will be
      analyzed to determine the existing beam tilt that needs to be corrected.&nbsp;
      The procedure needs no calibration.&nbsp; This procedure is not needed and will
      not work on a Cs-corrected microscope.</p>
    <p>The operations and requirements described in&nbsp;<a href="#autotuning_by_ctf">Autotuning by CTF Fitting</a>
      all apply here.&nbsp; Aside from getting images with good Thon rings, the main
      challenge may be getting beam-tilted images without the objective aperture or
      beam edge intruding.&nbsp; However, getting good Thon rings along the long axis
      of the ellipse in astigmatic images can also be a challenge.</p>
    <p>The maximum beam tilt should be in the range of 4 to 10 milliradians,
      preferably between 6 and 8.&nbsp; A common problem when first trying the routine
      is that the beam tilt set for use with the original image displacement-based
      coma-free alignment is too large for this method, giving excessively astigmatic
      images that cannot be fit accurately. The goal is to get defocus changes ranging up
      to 0.3-0.4 micron (and thus astigmatism should be in this range too).&nbsp; The defocus changes being measured are proportional to
      the square of the beam tilt, so the reliability of the estimated misalignment
      will increase accordingly.&nbsp; However, another common problem is that if the
      microscope&#39;s beam tilt is far from the coma-free value, the astigmatism imposed
      by additional modest beam tilts gets too big for good fitting.&nbsp; If such
      problems occur when first running this routine, drop back to 4 mrad of beam tilt
      (or whatever is needed to reduce defocus changes to the desired level).&nbsp;
      Once you are nearer to a coma-free alignment, a high beam tilt can be used.&nbsp; Both the maximum beam tilt and whether to use a
      full array of images can be set with the <a href="#hid_focus_set_ctf_coma_bt">Set CTF Coma-free Params</A>
      command.</p>
    <p>There are two reasons why you might want to use a full 3x3 array of images
      instead of the basic 5 images along the X and Y axes of beam tilt.&nbsp; First,
      if the Thon rings are not very strong and the estimates of defocus vary much
      from one shot to the next (with no applied beam tilt), then you can use a full
      array to average over more of these noisy data.&nbsp; Second, you may find that
      the full array gives a solution consistently different from the one using 5
      images by an amount that you think matters.&nbsp; To assess this, you can use
      the script command FixComaByCtf to measure the beam tilt repeatedly without
      changing it.&nbsp; Run the two commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; FixComaByCtf 1 0 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; FixComaByCtf 1 0 1<br />
      repeatedly (in a loop) to measure the beam tilt with 5 and 10 images.&nbsp; You
      can see more details about the solution by setting Debug Output (in the
      Calibrate menu or in the properties) to 1 or any letters.&nbsp; In that case,
      the log will show the beam tilt from X and Y deflections as the &quot;solution&quot;
      values for axes 0 and 1, and the corresponding estimates from the diagonal
      deflections as the &quot;rotated diagonal solution&quot;.&nbsp; If they do differ by much,
      the average of the two is presumed to be a less biased estimate of the actual
      beam tilts.</p>
    <p>The method used to derive the beam tilts is described in

      <li><i>Binning</i>.&nbsp; Enter a specific binning or 0 to use the current Record
        binning.&nbsp; The CTF analysis itself should be fairly insensitive to binning
        unless it is too high, but you may want to use a binning higher than 1 to make
        the Thon rings extend farther out in the display.</li>
      <li><i>Drift settling time</i>.&nbsp; Enter a specific settling time, 0 to use
        the current Record settling, or -1 to use the current Record setting for frame 
        alignment as well.&nbsp; Without the latter entry, frame alignment will be 
        turned off.</li>
      <li><i>Field size</i>.&nbsp; Enter 1 to take full-field images, or 0 to use the
        current Record subarea if any.</li>
      <li>Smallest defocus value allowed for measuring and correcting astigmatism.&nbsp;
        The default is -0.9 micron and a value as small as -0.1 micron is allowed.&nbsp;
        Astigmatism calibration and coma measurement will require a larger
        defocus to allow for the astigmatism in these images, controlled by the next entry.</li>
      <li>Amount to increase underfocus when calibrating astigatism or measuring coma.&nbsp;
        The default is 0.5 micron and a value as small as 0.2 is allowed.

      <li><i>Whether to take a full array of images.</i>&nbsp; With a non-zero entry, it
        will take a 3x3 array of images and repeat the image at 0 beam tilt at the end.&nbsp;
        The difference in beam tilt along diagonals will be the same as that along the
        axes.&nbsp; See above for a discussion of when the full array is useful.</li>
      <li><i>Threshold for iterating.</i>&nbsp; The program will iterate the operation

        taken with no beam tilt.&nbsp; As of SerialEM 4.0, images are taken with Record 
        using the CTF acquire parameters, so these parameters as well as the defocus need to be set to give
        informative FFTs with good Thon rings if possible.&nbsp; If a focus calibration
        is available, the direction of beam tilt is set so that the long axis of the
        Thon rings is approximately tangential.&nbsp; However, this is just for a nice
        appearance: the direction of this axis is not an indicator of how well beam tilt
        is adjusted.&nbsp; Rather, when there is no coma, the FFTs on opposite sides of
        the center should look the same, with the same direction and elongation to the

      procedure first measures defocus and changes to the focus used for the
      astigmatism calibration that fits the current conditions. It then measures
      beam-tilt induced image shift for beam tilts in three directions and uses this
      information to solve for the astigmatism.&nbsp; If the change in stigmator
      settings is large enough, it then repeats the procedure one or two times.</P>
    <P>The beam tilt used is set with the <a href="#hid_focus_setastigbeamtilt">Set
      Astig Beam Tilt</a> command.&nbsp; It does not need to be the same as the beam
      tilt used for the calibration, which is recommended to be done at twice the beam
      tilt normally used for autofocusing.&nbsp; You may need to remove the objective
      aperture to run this operation with such a beam tilt, but it should be possible
      to get adequate results with the aperture in and a lower beam tilt, if
      necessary.&nbsp; Before running this command for the first time, you should use

      This routine is of limited accuracy and has been superceded by the CTF-based

      was done, and measures beam-tilt induced image shift for positive and negative
      beam tilts in X and Y directions.&nbsp; From the difference between
      displacements, it estimates the current beam tilt and adjusts for it.&nbsp; To
      reduce the inaccuracy of the measurement, this procedure can be run for
      additional iterations (one more by default, adjustable with the <a href="#hid_focus_setcomaiterations">Set Coma Iterations</a>
      command).&nbsp; On each iteration, the estimated coma-free beam tilt is averaged

      <P>This command toggles more complete output from focusing operations. With the
        option selected, the shift and drift information are printed in the Log window
        on every autofocus, as well as the cross-correlation coefficient between
        unfiltered images. With the option not selected, the measured defocus value and
        the use of a secondary peak will still be reported to the Log window, but only
        if it is already open.</P>
