      <br />
    In the following, the &quot;active window&quot; means the current buffer in the main 
    window or a single-image window if it is the active window; the stack of images 
    created as extra output from a tilt series is excluded even if it is the active 
    window.<BR>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_minmaxmean"></A><B>Min/Max/Mean command (Process menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to obtain the minimum, maximum, and mean values of the image 
        in the active window or a subarea of it. The information will appear in a 
        message box, or in the Log window if it is open. The computation is done on the 
        active window, which may not be the main window. If there is a box drawn on 
        this image (which you can do with Ctrl-Shift and the left mouse button), the 
        statistics within the box are given, along with the size and location of teh 
        box.&nbsp; If there is no box drawn, the program will also report the pixel 
        size of the image.</P>
      <P>Shortcut Key:CTRL+I</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_zerotiltmean"></A><B>Zero-tilt mean command (Process menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to obtain the mean value of the approximate area in the 
        current buffer that corresponds to the full field at zero tilt. For example, if 
        the tilt is 60 degrees, the magnification is such that the tilt axis is near 
        vertical, and the image is 1024 pixels wide, then the mean will be taken of the 
        central half of the image with X between 512 and 768. Note that the mean is 
        taken of the current buffer in the main window, even if it is not the active 
        window.</P>
      <P>Shortcut Key:CTRL+Z</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_fft"></A><B>FFT command (Process menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to take a full-sized Fourier transform (FFT) of the image in 
        the active window. The FFT will be placed into buffer A and existing images will be 
        rolled to higher buffers to the extent specified in the Buffer Control Panel, 
        just as when a new image is acquired.</P>
    <P>If you have an FFT that shows Thon rings, you can click at the first minimum 
      (the first zero of the CTF) to determine the defocus.&nbsp; The program will 
      draw a circle through the clicked location and circles at the expected positions 
      of several more minima (5 total by default).&nbsp; The estimated defocus will be 
      displayed in the middle pane of the status bar.&nbsp; Once the circles are 
      drawn, you can click again near any one of the circles to refine the fit to the 
      minima in the FFT.&nbsp; For the inner circles, you have to avoid clicking 
      midway between two circles or it will think you are picking a new first zero position; for 
      the outer two circles it will always refine based on one of those two circles.&nbsp; 
      Click in one of the corners or very near the middle of the FFT to remove the circles.</P>
    <P>The defocus is computed using the voltage determined from the microscope, an 
      objective lens spherical aberration value of 2 mm, and an amplitude contrast 
      ratio of 0.07.&nbsp; The property &#39;FFTZeroParams&#39; can be used to modify these 
      parameters or the number of circles drawn, but this is not essential.&nbsp; The 
      estimated defocus is quite insensitive to the value of the spherical aberration.&nbsp; 
      The amplitude contrast ratio affects mostly the position of the first circle, so 
      an estimate refined from higher order circles will also be insensitive to this 
      parameter.</P>
    <P>The equations used currently give invalid results for higher-order zeros at a 
      defocus smaller than about -0.3 and for the defocus itself at a defocus smaller 
      than about -0.15, so fewer rings and eventually no rings at all will appear for 
      small defocus values.</P>
      <P>Shortcut Key:SHIFT+F</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_binnedfft"></A><B>Binned FFT command (Process menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to take a binned FFT of the image in the active window. Before taking 
        the FFT, the image will be padded to be square and binned down by a factor of 
        2, 3, or 4. The target size after binning is 1024 by 1024; a binning factor of 
        2 will be used if the image is already this small, and a factor of 4 will be 
        used if the image is larger than 4096 by 4096. The FFT will be placed into 
        buffer A and existing images will be rolled to higher buffers to the extent 
        specified in the Buffer Control Panel, just as when a new image is acquired.</P>
      <P>Shortcut Key:SHIFT+B</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_livefft"></A><B>Live FFT command (Process menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to have FFTs computed automatically when images are taken in 
        continuous acquisition mode. The FFT will replace the acquired image.</P>
      <P>Shortcut Key:SHIFT+L</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_side_by_side"></A><B>Side by Side command (Process menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to have FFTs displayed in a window next to the main image 
      display window.&nbsp; This window is a stack of 8 buffers that will roll to save 
      up to 7 FFTs when a new single FFT is taken.&nbsp; For a live FFT in 
      continuous mode, the top buffer will be continually replaced.&nbsp; After this 
      option is turned on, the window will be created when an FFT is taken.&nbsp; You 
      can close the window, and it will be reopened when another FFT is taken.&nbsp; 
      The window is closed when the option is turned off.</P>
    <P>Shortcut Key: SHIFT+S</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_automaticffts"></A><B>Automatic Single FFTs command (Process menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to have FFTs computed automatically for every new single-frame 
      (non-continuous mode) image whenever the side-by-side FFT window is already 
      open.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_process_circleonlivefft"></A><B>Circle on Live FFT command (Process 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to have one or more circles drawn on the live FFT images. By 
        default, one circle is drawn, but there are two options for getting more 
        circles.&nbsp; First, a custom set of circle radii, in reciprocal pixels, can be defined 
        with the FFTCircleRadii property.&nbsp; Second, the following command can be 
        used to set a defocus for which circles will be drawn at the zeros of the CTF.</P>
    <P>Note that if you have left-clicked on a live FFT and there are now circles in 
      the FFT corresponding to a defocus readout in the status bar, you can return to 
      the defined set of circles by clicking near the corner or very near the center 
      of the FFT.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_process_setdefocusforcircles"></A><B>Set Defocus for Circles command (Process 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set a fixed defocus that defines where circles will be 
        drawn on a live FFT, namely at the zeros of the CTF for that defocus.&nbsp; 
        Underfocus is negative, as in all defocus readouts.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_process_setphaseplateshift"></A><B>Set Phase Plate Shift command (Process 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to define the phase shift imposed by a phase plate (a positive 
        value in degrees).&nbsp; This phase shift will be taken into account when 
        circles are drawn on a live FFT for the fixed defocus defined by the previous 
        command, or when a defocus is reported after left-clicking on an FFT.&nbsp; If a 
        non-zero shift has been entered, the defocus in the status bar will be followed 
        by &#39;(PP)&#39;.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_rotateleft"></A><B>Rotate Left command (Process menu)</B></P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_rotateright"></A><B>Rotate Right command (Process menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use these commands to rotate the image in the active buffer counterclockwise 
        (left) or clockwise (right) by 90 degrees. The rotated image will be placed 
        into buffer A and existing images will be rolled to higher buffers to the 
        extent specified in the Buffer Control Panel, just as when a new image is 
        acquired.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_cropimage"></A><B>Crop Image command (Process menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command is available if you have drawn either a box or a line in the 
        active image (with Ctrl-Shift-left mouse or Shift-left mouse, respectively). 
        Use the command to crop out the image area inside a drawn box, or inside the 
        box around a drawn line. The cropped image will be placed into buffer A and 
        existing images will be rolled to higher buffers to the extent specified in the 
        Buffer Control Panel, just as when a new image is acquired.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_makecoloroverlay"></A><B>Make Color Overlay command 
          (Process menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to overlay two or three images in any buffers into a single 
        color image. A dialog will open, in which you specify which buffers to use for 
        the red, green, and blue components of the image. You do this by entering three 
        letters for the desired buffers, or a 0 if no image is desired for one 
        component. For example, you can enter ABC to take red from the image in A, 
        green from the image in B, and blue from the image in C; AB0 to make a 
        red-green overlay of the images in A and B; ABA to make a magenta - green 
        overlay of the images in A and B; AAB for a yellow-blue overlay; ABB for a 
        red-cyan overlay, etc. The images will be scaled by whatever scaling is 
        currently used to display them and will also be shifted by whatever shifts have 
        been imposed by autoalignment or shifting with the right mouse button. (The 
        latter feature could be made optional if users require it.) The color overlay 
        image will be placed in buffer A and existing images will be rolled to higher 
        buffers to the extent specified in the Buffer Control Panel, just as when a new 
        image is acquired. The color image can be saved to an MRC or TIFF file.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_showcrosscorr"></A><B>Show Cross-corr command (Process 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to show the cross-correlation used to autoalign the image in 
        buffer A to the image in the autoalign buffer.&nbsp; The correlation will be 
        placed into Buffer A and existing images will be rolled to higher buffers, just 
        as when a new image is acquired.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_autocorrelation"></A><B>Autocorrelation command (Process 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to compute the autocorrelation of the image in buffer A.&nbsp; 
        The correlation will be placed into Buffer A and existing images will be rolled 
        to higher buffers, just as when a new image is acquired.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_fixdarkxrays"></A><B>Fix Dark X-rays command (Process menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to apply the X-ray removal routine to the image in the active 
        window, 
        using the criteria for removal of X-rays from dark references. The image with 
        X-rays removed will be placed in Buffer A, and existing images will be rolled 
        to higher buffers to the extent specified in the Buffer Control Panel, just as 
        when a new image is acquired.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_setdarkcriteria"></A><B>Set Dark Criteria command (Process 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set the criteria for dark reference X-ray removal. First 
        you will encounter a dialog box asking for a criterion for the absolute amount 
        above the mean, then another dialog asking for a criterion for the number of 
        standard deviations above the mean, then a final dialog asking whether a pixel 
        must satisfy both criteria or just one of them. These criteria replace the ones 
        specified in the property file and will apply only during this session of the 
        program.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_fiximagexrays"></A><B>Fix Image X-rays command (Process 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to apply the X-ray removal routine to the image in the active 
        window, 
        using the criteria for removal of X-rays from images. The image with X-rays 
        removed will be placed in Buffer A, and existing images will be rolled to 
        higher buffers to the extent specified in the Buffer Control Panel, just as 
        when a new image is acquired.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_setimagecriteria"></A><B>Set Image Criteria command 
          (Process menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set the criteria for X-ray removal from images, which is 
        activated for a particular camera with the ShowRemoveXRaysBox property and for 
        individual camera parameter sets with the <B>Remove X rays</B> checkbox in the <A HREF="hidd_camerasetup.htm">
          Camera Setup dialog box</A>. First you will encounter a dialog box asking for 
        a criterion for the absolute amount above the mean, then another dialog asking 
        for a criterion for the number of standard deviations above the mean, then a 
        final dialog asking whether a pixel must satisfy both criteria or just one of 
        them. These criteria are camera-specific; they are stored in your settings file 
        and will persist between sessions of the program.</P>
