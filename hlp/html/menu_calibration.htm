      <P><A name="hid_calibration_imageshift"></A><B>Image Shift command (Calibration - 
        Image &amp; Stage Shift sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command starts calibration of image shift at the current magnification. 
        You should always calibrate image shift at the appropriate magnification when 
        montaging. Image shift is calibrated by taking 9 pictures at different shifted 
        positions. Every other picture is taken in the unshifted position, so that drift 
        can be eliminated. Exposures are done with images binned to 1024 pixels for 
        direct detector cameras or 512 pixels for other cameras, using an 
        exposure time based on the settings in the Trial parameter set.&nbsp; This 
        binning can prevented by turning on the <a href="#hid_imagestageshift_usetrialbinning">
            Use Trial Binning</a> option to make it use whatever binning 
        is in the Trial parameter set.&nbsp; Similarly, full-field images will be taken 
        unless <a href="#hid_imagestageshift_usetrialsize">Use 
            Trial Size</a> is turned on.&nbsp; It is important that the images have 
        sufficient detail and enough counts to give reliable correlations.&nbsp; Either 
        kind of&nbsp; deficiency will be reflected by a low cross-correlation 
        coefficient (CCC, reported after the procedure); it is best to keep the CCC 
        above 0.5. </P>
      <P>If image shift has already been calibrated at any magnification in the same 
        magnification range, the procedure takes advantage of this information to set 
        the image shifts of the shifted pictures. Otherwise, calibration is done in two 
        rounds, first with very limited shifts, then with more wide-ranging ones. On FEI 
        scopes, there 
        are two magnification ranges for image shift calibrations: LM mode mags and all 
        higher mags.&nbsp; On JEOL and Hitachi scopes, there will typically be 
        additional boundaries defined between smaller mag ranges.</P>
      <P>At the end, you will see messages about the minimum and mean CCCs, the calibration matrix that was 
        measured, the amount of error in those values, the amount of drift that was 
        detected during the sequence of pictures, and a statement about the quality of 
        the calibration. At this point, you may be offered the opportunity to change all 
        other existing image shift calibrations in the same mag range by the same 
        amount. If your calibration is good, this will eliminate the need to recalibrate 
        at the other magnifications.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the calibration is bad 
        enough, you will be asked if you want the program to forget about it, which is 
        usually a good idea.</P>
      <P>The program will apply a shift to the pictures taken with image shift to show 
        how they align with the pictures in the central position. If you set up to roll 
        buffers A through M in the Buffer Control panel before starting the calibration, 
        then you can scroll through all the images and view the alignments. This could 
        be important for verifying the alignment when a calibration grating is used at 
        relatively low magnification.</P>
      <P>This procedure may fail if existing calibrations are far off, which can happen 
        when the microscope alignment has been changed. If this happens, you should run 
        the <A href="#hid_calibration_isfromscratch">IS from Scratch command</A> .&nbsp; 
        Also, if there is a lot of distortion, the procedure may report a relatively 
        poor result; this is common in the bottom two SA magnifications of a Krios in 
        EFTEM mode.&nbsp; A remedy here is to use a half area, or even a quarter area if 
        necessary.&nbsp; Turn on <a href="#hid_imagestageshift_usetrialsize">Use 
            Trial Size</a>, adjust the binning if necessary so that there are still ~500 
        pixels, and increase the beam intensity to compensate for the loss in image 
        area.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_isfromscratch"></A><B>IS from Scratch command 
        (Calibration - Image &amp; Stage Shift sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will calibrate image shift in two rounds (13 pictures), without 
        relying on any existing image shift calibrations. This procedure is needed for 
        the first calibration in a magnification range and may be needed when the image 
        shift calibration in the microscope alignment has been changed by a large 
        amount. It does rely on the program's current notion of the pixel size at the 
        current magnification, and can fail if that notion is way off.&nbsp; The pixel 
        size will be based on either a calibrated pixel size for this magnification 
        entered on a 'RotationAndPixel' line for this camera, or on the 
        FilmToCameraMagnification value for this camera.&nbsp; If you have trouble with 
        this procedure, start at a magnification where you can run the <A HREF="#hid_process_findpixelsize">
        Find Pixel Size command</A> successfully, and do so before starting this 
        calibration.&nbsp; The program will give you a chance to use the pixel size from 
        that routine if it differs enough from the one indicated by the 
        FilmToCameraMagnification value.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_stageshift"></A><B>Stage Shift command (Calibration - 
        Image &amp; Stage Shift sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will calibrate the relation between stage movements and position 
        on the camera at a particular magnification. This calibration requires moving 
        the stage over relatively large distances, not just because small movements 
        would be inherently inaccurate, but also because the stage may have systematic 
        and periodic inaccuracies. In the Compustage, the distance actually moved per 1 
        micron of requested movement can be less or more than 1 micron by as much as 
        ~15%, and the pattern of the error repeats every 40-60 microns (an effect first 
        described by Pulokas et al., 1999). Stage calibration is 
        done over a defined distance, taking up to 15 steps if needed to cover that 
        distance. The distances in X and Y are set with two properties, 
        StageCycleLengthX and StageCycleLengthY, whose defaults for FEI scopes (62 and 41 microns) are 
        based on the values found on the two Tecnais in Boulder, which match those found 
        in Pulokas at el., 1999. See <A href="setting_up_serialem.htm#setup_scopecal">
          Other Microscope Calibrations</A> for instructions on assessing the cycle 
        length. Even if you do not have the right cycle length, the calibration should 
        be fairly accurate because it is done over a long distance.&nbsp; This effect is 
        apparently minimal on JEOLs and the Hitachi HT7700, so the default there is 40 
        microns.</P>
      <P>This calibration is helpful if montages are going to be done with stage shift, 
        such as when making maps with the Navigator. It is recommended that you do it at 
        the lowest useful magnification not in LM mode. It can be done at a higher 
        magnification instead, but that will require more steps. If the Navigator is 
        going to be used, the calibration should be done at 2 or 3 mags in LM mode, such 
        as the highest one, an intermediate one, and one near the lowest mag where whole 
        grid montages would be done. If the image on the screen appears unstable in LM 
        mode (presumably due to charging effects), try using the smallest objective 
        aperture that does not occlude the image on the camera.</P>
      <P>Before doing the calibration, you should have measured and entered into the 
        properties file at least one pixel size in the LM range and in the regular mag 
        range. The rotation angle between the lowest M-mode mag and the highest mag in 
        LM mode should also be entered, unless whole image correlations are being used.</P>
      <P>You should have a specimen other than the replica grating for this calibration, 
        and either one on a slot grid or one with relatively large spacing between grid 
        bars. On an older FEI scope, if the calibration is done over an area that fits within 
        one grid square of the replica grating, there is a good chance that it will be 
        off by 10%.&nbsp; On a JEOL, where the cycle length is probably not relevant and 
        a correlation over only 20-25 microns may be accurate enough, the replica 
        grating can be used, unless calibrating with a camera on a GIF (see the
        <a href="#hid_calibration_whole_image_corr">Whole Image Corr command</a>).&nbsp; 
        Also, the replica grating could be used on an FEI scope at a mag low enough so 
        that there are several grid squares in the field, provided that there is enough 
        visible difference between the grid squares. Aside from this, correlations may 
        not work when the image contains grid bars. There need to be image features 
        useful for correlation throughout the region that will be used (~60 microns). 
        Position the specimen in the middle of such a region before starting the 
        calibration. If you have difficulty getting a specimen area large enough for the 
        calibration, you can limit its extent with the property MaxStageCalExtent.</P>
      <P>After you start the procedure, the program will tell you how many pictures will 
        be taken and the total distance over which the calibration will be done. It will 
        take a series of pictures with movements in X, then a series with stage 
        movements in Y. After each picture except the first in each series, it will 
        toggle for a few seconds between two images that are supposed to line up. Watch 
        and make sure that the images do line up. If not, stop the calibration. At the 
        end it will report the transformation matrix, the maximum range for the multiple 
        estimates of each factor, and the implied transformation from stage to specimen 
        coordinates (provided that there is sufficient information to derive the 
        latter). The variation between estimates should be less than 10%, and the stage 
        to specimen transformation should be close to -1.0 0. 0. -1.0; if not, you 
        should redo the calibration unless you are sure that the paired images all lined 
        up well. The stage to specimen transformation can differ from -1 0 0 -1 if there 
        is an error in the rotation angle for this magnification derived from the 
        entries in the properties file (e.g., a 10&deg; error will result in middle terms of 
        &plusmn;0.17).</P>
      <P>The calibration also reports an estimate for the rotation angle of this 
        magnification; this appears to be accurate within 0.2-0.5 degrees.</P>
    <P><A name="hid_calibration_whole_image_corr"></A><B>Whole Image Corr command 
      (Calibration - Image &amp; Stage Shift sub-menu)</B></P>
    <P>This commands toggles whether the image correlations used for stage calibration 
      are done over the whole image area or just over the region of expected overlap.&nbsp; 
      Whole image correlations are on by default because they work robustly with 
      non-periodic specimens and make the calibration procedure immune to large errors 
      in the image rotation angles specified in the properties file.&nbsp; When 
      correlating just the region of expected overlap, the procedure will fail if 
      these angles are off by more than 40 degrees. Whole image correlations also work 
      robustly with a cross-line grating with latex beads, provided that there are 
      enough beads in the field and that image distortions are not too large.&nbsp; 
      They will not work when calibrating GIF images with the grating, the 
      overlap-only correlations are more reliable but can also fail in that case.&nbsp; 
      Use a non-periodic specimen for stage calibrations on a GIF.&nbsp; The whole 
      image correlations can also fail at very low magnification if using the 
      cross-line grating, because the grid bars can dominate the alignment.&nbsp; Use 
      a specimen with larger grid squares and keep this option on, or turn this option 
      off and make sure that the image rotation angles are approximately correct 
      before calibrating the lowest magnifications. </P>

    <P>Use this command to set the cycle lengths for stage calibration, which 
      determine the distances in X and Y over which the calibration is run.&nbsp; 
      Specifically, the calibration is run over this distance, if possible, at higher 
      magnifications, and over a multiple of this distance at lower magnifications 
      when only three images are being acquired in each direction.&nbsp; This setting 
      is temporary, not saved when the program exits; change the properties 
      'StageCycleLengthX' and StageCycleLengthY' to make a permanent change.&nbsp; The 
      cycle lengths should not be changed for FEI scopes except for experimenting, 
      unless it is found that the systematic variation in stage movement is minimal 
      with a particular stage.</P>

      achieving a good signal-to-noise ratio without saturating the camera.&nbsp; It 
      will not make the cross-correlations more prone to failure, because images are

      <P><A name="hid_calibration_listisvectors"></A><B>List IS Vectors command 
        (Calibration - Image &amp; Stage Shift sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to get a listing of the length and angles of the image shift 
        calibration vectors for all magnifications where image shift has been 
        calibrated. This listing can provide a check on the accuracy of the image shift 
        calibrations and, on a JEOL, reveal magnification boundaries where there are 
        discontinuities in the image shift calibration.&nbsp; A length and an angle are 
        computed for a change in the X image shift and for a change in the Y image 
        shift. The vector lengths represent the estimated microns moved on the specimen 
        per nominal micron of applied image shift, so the lengths should be near 1, 
        unless using projector shifts (PLA) for image shift on a JEOL, in which case 
        they should decline continuously within a magnification range.. The 
        angles are angles on the specimen and they should stay constant as long as there 
        is no discontinuity in image shift behavior.</P>
      <P>These estimates are based on the pixel size and image rotation angle at each 
        magnification, which can be obtained in one of two ways. The pixel size can be 
        derived from the nominal film magnification, the camera pixel size, and the 
        magnification ratio from the film plane to the camera; while the image rotation 
        angle can be derived from the magnification table. Alternatively, a calibrated 
        pixel size from the property file can be used whenever available, as well as a 
        calibrated rotation angle. (Note that if there is one mag with an absolute 
        calibration of the angle and a contiguous series of mags with relative rotations 
        entered, all of those mags are considered to have calibrated rotation angles). 
        The latter option will give the most accurate estimate of the vector lengths but 
        one can expect to see small discontinuities in the lengths between the mags with 
        and without calibrated pixel sizes. Similarly, the angles will be most accurate 
        but there will be discontinuities between mags with and without calibrated 
        angles. Thus, if you have calibrated only one or two pixel sizes, just use the 
        estimates based on the nominal magnification (answer NO to the query). If you 
        have calibrated many pixel sizes, as is necessary on a JEOL, answer YES to use 
        these pixel sizes and get the best indication of whether there are 
        discontinuities that need to be specified with the OtherShiftBoundaries 
        property.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_liststagecals"></A><B>List Stage Cals command

      <P>This command will convert the stage calibration for each magnification into a 
        specimen to stage transformation and also show the average transformation that 
        is being used regardless of mag. This allows the consistency of the calibrations 
        to be assessed at any time. Transformations should be near -1. 0. 0. -1.&nbsp; 
        Often when this is not the case, the first and last terms have a similar 
        absolute value and the second and third terms have a similar absolute value, all 
        corresponding to the sine and cosine of some angle (e.g., -0.85&nbsp; 0.52&nbsp; 
        -0.47&nbsp; 0.87). This pattern indicates that the calibration is probably good 
        but that the program has an incorrect notion of the absolute rotation angle at 
        the given magnification.&nbsp; Transformations that do not fit this pattern are 
        generally bad.</P>
    <P><a name="hid_imagestageshift_removeiscal"></a><B>Remove IS Cal command 
      (Calibration - Image &amp; Stage Shift sub-menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to remove one image shift calibration for the current camera.&nbsp; 
      The program will ask for the magnification of the calibration, then show you the 
      matrix and ask you to confirm the removal.&nbsp; Use
      <a href="#hid_calibration_listisvectors">List IS Vectors</a> first to see 
      which calibrations have a vector length or axis angle clearly different from the 
      rest.&nbsp; When an image shift calibration is done, it is saved automatically 
      in the short term calibration file (SEMshortTermCal.txt) for a day, so even if 
      the calibration has not been intentionally saved to the main file 
      (SerialEMcalibrations.txt), it can linger to have bad effects.&nbsp; This 
      command can be used to remove its effects instead of rerunning the calibration 
      from scratch.&nbsp; The consequences of the command depend on whether the 
      particular calibration has been saved to the main file:
    <ul>
      <li><i>Bad calibration saved to main file</i>: You must save the calibrations again to 
        remove it fully; otherwise it will reappear when you restart the program.&nbsp; 
        You must redo the calibration at some point to have a calibration for that 
        magnification.</li>
      <li><i>Bad calibration <b>not</b> saved to file</i>: You do not need to save 
        calibrations, but if you do, they will not include this calibration.&nbsp; 
        Restart the program to revert to a previous calibration, if any.</li>

      <P><A name="hid_calibration_magisoffsets"></A><B>Mag IS Offsets command 
        (Calibration - Image &amp; Stage Shift sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to determine image shift offsets that will keep a feature 
        centered as magnification is changed. This calibration is needed to get the best 
        performance from the Navigator, such as when a position is marked on an image at 
        one magnification and then sought at a much higher magnification. One of the 
        limitations to this kind of localization is the degree to which the image shifts 
        when the beam is moved, which can be particularly severe in LM mode depending on 
        the focus setting. To minimize the effect of this shifting, you will be advised 
        to keep the beam centered in LM mode during this calibration. More importantly, 
        the program will go to a standard focus in LM mode if one is defined. On an FEI scope, 
        this is defined by default to be at 'eucentric focus'; on a JEOL, a 
        numeric value for the standard focus needs to be determined with the 
        'ReportFocus' script command and entered as the property StandardLowMagFocus.</P>
    <P>The disadvantage of the calibration is that it gets off over time more easily 
      than other calibrations, and becomes invalid when magnification alignment in the 
      scope itself is redone.&nbsp; When working in Low Dose mode, it is possible to 
      use Search and View offsets for all mapping and navigating, and this will 
      obviate the need for this calibration.</P>
      <P>It is recommended that the offsets be calibrated from the highest magnification 
        where there is an obvious misalignment between magnifications, down to the 
        lowest magnification to be used for Navigator mapping. The entire range does not 
        need to be done at once. The calibration can be done just over parts of the 
        range where the misalignments are bad. If the offsets are recalibrated over a 
        subset of the range, the new values will be merged in with the old ones 
        determined for the other magnifications.</P>
      <P>To do the calibration, you need a specimen with a feature that can be centered 
        over the full range of magnifications to be calibrated. The corner of a section 
        works well for this. Before you start, set up the beam to a reasonable size and 
        brightness and turn on Intensity Zoom if available. Do this in both regular mag 
        and LM mode. Set up Trial parameters to give an adequate image for centering the 
        feature. Go to the highest magnification to be calibrated and start the 
        procedure. You will see a message box with instructions, then you will be asked 
        whether you want to take a trial image automatically at each new magnification. 
        This is convenient if Intensity Zoom or an equivalent intensity adjustment is on, but may be problematic otherwise.&nbsp; 
        Continuous acquisition mode can also be used for the routine, and there will be 
        blanking during the magnification changes.&nbsp; If you use continuous mode, the 
        program will skip the Trial images.&nbsp; Use the space bar to stop continuous 
        mode without stopping the routine.</P>
      <P>This calibration routine is nearly unique in that it allows you to operate the program 
        and waits for notification that an image is aligned. It converts the first Script 
        button in the Camera &amp; Script Control Panel into a 'NextMag' button that you 
        press after an image is aligned. The 'End' and 'STOP' buttons in that panel are 
        used to stop the procedure. The distinction between them is that 'End' will 
        record an image shift for the current magnification whereas 'STOP' will not.&nbsp; </P>
      <P>After you start the routine, center the image feature by shifting with the 
        right mouse button. You can use stage shift at this point if necessary, but 
        thereafter you must shift only with image shift. (The option for moving the 
        stage for big mouse movements is disabled during the procedure to prevent stage 
        shifts.) At each magnification, center the feature then press 'NextMag'. The 
        program will make sure that you are at the correct magnification, record the 
        image shift, lower the magnification, and take a picture if you selected that 
        option.</P>
      <P>When you step down into LM mode, try to keep the objective aperture in, 
        switching to the largest aperture when necessary, then taking out the aperture 
        when necessary. On both an F20 and an F30, this has been seen to eliminate 
        strange charging effects that can affect image size and position.</P>
      <P>One magnification must be set as the reference where the image shift offset is 
        zero. After you end the routine, you will be asked which magnification should 
        have its offset set to zero. You should specify the magnification typically used 
        for tomography, so that there will not be large amounts of 'hidden' image shift 
        there. If you calibrated only below that magnification, you can specify the top 
        of the range that was calibrated and achieve the same result.</P>
      <P>If you have both a preGIF and a GIF camera, the setting of a reference is more 
        complicated. Once an offset between the two cameras has been defined, only one 
        camera can have a magnification with an offset of zero, so you will be asked to 
        specify which camera this is to be.</P>
      <P>This calibration requires that image shift be calibrated at least once in every 
        defined magnification range. On an FEI scope, this just means you need at least 
        one image shift calibration in LM mode, in addition to the many that you should 
        have done in regular mag mode. On a JEOL, this may mean that you need to 
        calibrate image shift at every mag of interest, then use 'List IS Vectors' to 
        determine image shift boundaries, and define those boundaries with the 
        'OtherShiftBoundaries' property.</P>
      <P>Once there is an image shift offset calibration, you can turn on 'Adjust image 
        shift between mags' in the Image Alignment &amp; Focus control panel. The 
        calibration routine will work with this option on, and recalibration might be 
        easier with it on.</P>

      <P>Use this command to calibrate the image shift offset needed to align images 
        from a preGIF and GIF camera. If you have such cameras, the recommended initial 
        procedure would be to calibrate the image shift offsets on the preGIF camera, 
        then run this command, then calibrate the offsets on the GIF camera. However,

        <LI>
          Go to a magnification not in LM mode on the preGIF camera and center a feature.

        <LI>
          Copy this image to the first buffer after the buffers that roll, the usual

          expects this image to be in.)
        <LI>
          Go to EFTEM mode and take an image. Center the feature using autoalignment or 
          mouse shift only, not stage shift.
        <LI>
          Invoke this command. If you have not already specified which camera should have 
          one magnification with image shift offset set to zero, you will be asked about

        command (Calibration menu)</B></P>
      <P style="Z-INDEX: 0">Use this command to set a factor for scaling the delay that 
        occurs after an image shift.&nbsp; This change applies&nbsp;only&nbsp;during&nbsp;this session 
        of the program; a permanent value can be set with the property 
        ISdelayScalingFactor.&nbsp; This delay is imposed because it takes some time for 
        image shift to settle at the target position, particularly on&nbsp;an FEI scope.&nbsp; 
        The need for more or less delay can be assessed by running the&nbsp;<A href="#hid_calibration_imageshift">Image&nbsp;Shift 
        command</A> in the Calibrate menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;First set the debug output key letters to 
        anything&nbsp;other than 0 (1 will do).&nbsp; Also, turn off <A href="menu_camera.htm#hid_camera_postactions">
          Post-actions</A>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Camera menu.&nbsp;Calibrate image shift and at the end it 
        will print &quot;Drift converted to IS in nm:&quot; followed by 4 lines computed from each 
        of the 4 times that the calibration returns to zero image shift.&nbsp; If image 
        shift is perfectly settled and drift is constant with components Xdrift and 
        Ydrift in the X and Y directions, then the 4 lines would all&nbsp;be&nbsp;similar and show 
        Xdrift and Ydrift.&nbsp; If image shift still needs to settle by an amount 
        Xsettling or Ysettling, for shifts in X or Y, then&nbsp;the lines would&nbsp;have the 
        form:<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Xdrift&nbsp;+ Xsettle&nbsp; Ydrift<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Xdrift - Xsettle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ydrift<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Xdrift&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ydrift + Ysettle<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Xdrift&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Ydrift - Ysettle</P>
      <P style="Z-INDEX: 0">The amount of shift due to inadequate settling&nbsp;is reflected 
        by&nbsp;the differences between the first two X numbers, and between the last two Y 
        numbers.&nbsp;For example, with good settling and some drift, the numbers&nbsp;in one set 
        of tests&nbsp;were:<BR>
        -1.6 1.4<BR>
        -1.8 1.2<BR>
        -1.5 1.3<BR>
        -1.5 1.0
      </P>
      <P style="Z-INDEX: 0">Here, the differences reflecting settling are minimal&nbsp;(0.2 
        and 0.3) and are probably just due to the fact that drift was declining during 
        the run.&nbsp; With a reduced delay factor, these numbers became:<BR>
        -0.2 0.5<BR>
        -1.2 0.3<BR>
        -0.2 0.9<BR>
        -0.5 -0.5
      </P>
      <P style="Z-INDEX: 0">Here the X difference is 1.0 and the Y difference is 1.4 - 
        image shift has not settled completely.&nbsp; With virtually no delay factor the 
        differences become extreme (8.3 and 10.7)and no longer fit the simple model 
        above because effects linger from one pair of pictures to the next:<BR>
        &nbsp;2.6 0.1<BR>
        -5.7 0.1<BR>
        &nbsp;2.5 3.7<BR>
        -0.1 -7.0
      </P>
      <P style="Z-INDEX: 0">The protocol is thus to change the delay factor and&nbsp;run the 
        calibration repeatedly,&nbsp;looking for&nbsp;the delay factor at which the X and Y 
        differences due to settling either become very small or stabilize.&nbsp; Do this 
        at several magnifications (e.g., 5000, 15000, 25000) to make sure the scale 
        factor is appropriate over a range of mags.&nbsp; On a JEOL, there may be 
        differences that appear to be due to incomplete settling, but if the differences 
        remain constant as the scaling factor is increased, then the lowest factor at 
        which the differences&nbsp;have these stable values&nbsp;is appropriate.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_findpixelsize"></A><B>Find Pixel Size command (Calibration 
        - Pixel Size sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to analyze an image of the cross-line replica grating in 
        buffer A and determine the pixel size. The program will take a filtered 
        autocorrelation, which produces a square grid of correlation peaks with the 
        highest peak at the center, where the image correlates perfectly with itself. It 
        finds a starting peak close to the center, then locates peaks progressively 
        farther out so that it can estimate the spacing between peaks from as many 
        intervals as possible. Next it searches for a peak 90 degrees away from the 
        starting peak, and finds peaks progressively farther out along that line. It 
        averages the interval between peaks in the two directions and then computes a 
        pixel size.</P>
      <P>When it is successful, this routine shows the autocorrelation in buffer A, and 
        leaves the green marker on the starting peak. It writes one line to the log 
        window showing the mean spacing and number of intervals in each direction, and 
        the size of the pixels in the image that was analyzed, which will be a binned 
        pixel size if the image was binned. It writes a second line with the unbinned 
        pixel size, although if the image was read from a file it will label this as 
        'APPARENTLY unbinned'. If the image was not read from a file, a final line will 
        be written with the magnification index, unbinned pixel size, and magnification.</P>
    <P>Images larger than a certain size are binned down to improve the signal-to-noise ratio 
      for the analysis.&nbsp; By default, the target size is picked automatically when 
      using a cross-line replica grating; see the <A HREF="#hid_process_setbinnedsize">Set Binned 
      Size command</A> for details. The program will output a line indicating the 
      target size and the number of blocks that it expects to appear in the image.&nbsp; 
      When first getting started, watch carefully that the number of blocks is close 
      to correct; if it is off by much, it means that the program's current 
      assumptions about pixel size are substantially off.&nbsp; The best thing to do 
      in that case is to make sure the correct peak has been found, exit the program, 
      and insert the pixel size for this magnification into a RotationAndPixel line in 
      the camera properties.&nbsp; This better pixel size should make the routine pick 
      the right binning for the whole mag range.</P>
    <P>Reported distances are in terms of pixels in the original 
      image, but if you look at the actual number of pixels between peaks it will be 
      smaller by the binning factor.&nbsp; Also note that dark regions are trimmed out 
      before analysis.</P>
      <P>Always make sure that the correct starting point is picked - it needs to be one 
        of the points closest to the center peak, not one on a diagonal, or one between 
        the strong peaks. Zoom up if needed so that you can tell which point is the 
        central peak. If the point is incorrect, click a correct starting point and use 
        the <A HREF="#hid_process_pixelsizefrommarker">Try Again with Marker command</A>
        described next.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_pixelsizefrommarker"></A><B>Try Again with Marker command 
        (Calibration - Pixel Size sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command when the <A HREF="#hid_process_findpixelsize">Find Pixel Size 
        command</A> fails to show the correct starting point in the autocorrelation. 
        With the autocorrelation still in buffer A and the grating image in buffer B, 
        click with the left mouse button on one of the four points that are nearest to 
        the central peak of the autocorrelation. Then select this command. The program 
        will use the peak nearest to the marked point as the starting peak, but will 
        still have to find a peak 90 degrees away from it for measuring the other 
        direction.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_setbinnedsize"></A><B>Set Binned Size command (Calibration 
        - Pixel Size sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set the maximum size that images will be binned to when 
        running <A HREF="#hid_process_findpixelsize">Find Pixel Size</A>. The default 
        value is 0, which means that the program will automatically select a binned size 
        based on the expected number of blocks in the image of the cross-line replica 
        grating.&nbsp; (Sizes of 1024 or 512 are used when doing catalase or grid bars, 
        respectively.)&nbsp; Higher binning helps when there are relatively few peaks at 
        higher maginifications, and also when the peaks appear weak relative to the central 
        peak.&nbsp; If you have to set a specific size, try 512 first and adjust as 
        needed.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_pixelsize_add_to_rotation"></A><b>Add n*90 to a Rotation command

    Rotations</a> by a multiple of +/- 90 degrees.&nbsp; Enter the camera index, the 
    magnification index, and the amount to add to the reported angle.&nbsp; It may 
    be more convenient to use this method, at the time when the magnification in 
    question is being examined, than to adjust angles when getting a final listing.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_process_listrelativerotations"></A><B>List Relative Rotations 
      command (Calibration - Pixel Size sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to get a list of RotationAndPixel lines based on information
        determined with the pixel size finding routine. This information is saved 
        between sessions of the program for up to 24 hours in the file 
        SEMshortTermCal.txt.&nbsp; A line will be output for each
        magnification where the pixel size was also measured at the next lower
        magnification; i.e., where a relative rotation is available to be
        included in the line. However, the relative rotation values will
        sometimes have to be adjusted by 90 or even 180 degrees, either when
        there is a large rotation or when the difference is reported to be
        large for a small rotation. Whenever the difference is large, the
        program will also print an alternative difference nearer to zero.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_process_catalase_crystal"></A><B>Catalase Crystal 
      command (Calibration - Pixel Size sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command toggles whether the pixel size routine assumes that the image is 
        from a catalase crystal instead of from the replica grating.&nbsp; In this mode, 
        it will look for the closest-spaced regular peaks, which should correspond to 
        the 6.85 nm crystal spacing.&nbsp; After picking that closest peak, it will look 
        for the peaks 90 degrees away from that direction, which will be at twice the 
        8.75 nm crystal spacing.&nbsp; Thus, it will report finding many fewer peaks 
        along that line than along the short axis.&nbsp; The routine has not been 
        optimized for this specimen.&nbsp; Make sure that it finds the closest peak in 
        the correct direction, and mark that one if necessary.&nbsp; If it fails, try 
        reducing the binned size to 512 with the <A HREF="#hid_process_setbinnedsize">Set Binned 
      Size command</A>.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_pixelsize_meshforgridbars"></A><B>Mesh for Grid Bars 
      command (Calibration - Pixel Size sub-menu)</B></P>
    <P>When at least two grid bars appear in the image in each dimension, you can use 
      the pixel size routine to find a pixel size and grid angle, provided that you 
      first use this command to indicate the mesh size of the grid (mesh openings per 
      inch).&nbsp; The mesh size for the standard replica grating is 400.&nbsp; You 
      will probably need to reduce the binned size to 512 with the <A HREF="#hid_process_setbinnedsize">Set Binned 
      Size command</A>.&nbsp; When you are done calibrating magnifications where the 
      grid bars are useful, run this mesh size command again and enter 0.&nbsp; This 
      setting is not retained between runs of the program.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_autofocus"></A><B>Autofocus command
        (Calibration - Focus &amp; Tuning sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will calibrate autofocusing at the current magnification
        in TEM mode. This 
        involves going to a series of defocus levels and measuring the amount and 
        direction of image displacement between two pictures with the beam tilted by 
        positive and negative angles. Because this displacement does not vary linearly 
        with the defocus, the calibration consists of a whole curve of displacements as 
        a function of defocus, rather than just the slope and magnitude of a vector. 
        Nevertheless, the curve can be characterized for some purposes by a slope and 
        magnitude, and these parameters are used to assess how much the curve has 
        changed from the stored calibration.</P>
      <P>The defocus levels sampled in the calibration are controlled by the <A href="#hid_calibration_setfocusrange">
          Set Focus Range command</A> .</P>
      <P>Before calibrating autofocus, you should be sure that beam tilt pivot points are 
        well-aligned, that there is no condenser or objective astigmatism, and that the 
        Focus parameter set takes good pictures. Calibrate with a specimen that does 
        not require much drift settling, and do not calibrate at high tilt. Use as high 
        a beam tilt as is practicable to get the most accurate results (beam tilt can 
        be set under the Focus menu). The beam tilt during autofocusing does not need 
        to match the beam tilt used for calibration.</P>
      <P>Note that if image shift is calibrated at the various magnifications of 
        interest, there is no need to have an autofocus calibration at more than one 
        magnification. It is better to have one high quality focus calibration over a 
        large focus range rather than poorer calibrations at several magnifications.</P>
    <P>In STEM mode, this command is used to get an estimate of the amount that the 
      beam increases in size as defocus is changed away from focus.&nbsp; The value is 
      needed for autofocusing, but need not be very accurate.&nbsp; Nevertheless, if 
      the program eliminates points from the fit and/or suggests that you rerun the 
      procedure with a different focus range, do so.&nbsp; The focus range and number 
      of focus levels to test are specified in dialog boxes when you start the 
      command.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_setfocusrange"></A><B>Set Focus Range command (Calibration 
          - Focus &amp; Tuning sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command allows you to set the range and number of defocus levels that will 
        be assessed when calibrating autofocus. After you select the command, you will 
        make entries to four dialog boxes:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>
        Total defocus range to measure shifts over: The program will sample defocus 
        levels from half this range above the current defocus to half this range below 
        the current defocus, or will offset the whole range from the current defocus if a 
          non-zero offset is entered in the fourth box.
        <LI>
        Number of focus levels to test: This determines the interval of sampling; i.e., 
        the total defocus range divided by this number minus 1.
        <LI>
          Number of levels to smooth over (0 for none): The entry controls the amount of 
          linear smoothing of the curve, with no smoothing if 0 is entered. Smoothing 
          will reduce the effects of variability in the individual measurements. A value 
          of 3 is recommended.</LI>
        <LI>
          Offset to apply to the whole range to be tested (negative for underfocus).</LI>
    </OL>
      <p>
        For Falcon cameras, the standard range generally runs into problems with the 
        Falcon Dose Protector, usually just at the overfocus levels.&nbsp; The easiest 
        solution is to offset the range with the fourth entry.&nbsp; However, there is 
        no reason to measure at higher underfocus than normally, so the range should be 
        restricted as well as offset.&nbsp; The program will suggest values for the 
        first and fourth entries that will restrict the range on the overfocus side 
        only.</p>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_standardlmfocus"></A><B>Standard Focus command 
          (Calibration - Focus &amp; Tuning sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will store a standard or absolute focus value that can be 
        reapplied in various situations.&nbsp; In low magnification, 
        use the command to record the current defocus as a 
        standard focus that will be used when calibrating image or stage shift or 
        taking montages. You can calibrate the 
        standard LM focus at one magnification if that is sufficient, or you can do the 
        calibration at as many magnifications as are necessary. When the standard focus 
        is needed at an uncalibrated low magnification, the program will take the 
        calibration from the nearest calibrated LM one, or just assume a value of 0 on 
        an FEI scope if there are no calibrations in LM. The script command 
        &#39;SetEucentricFocus&#39; can also be used to set the focus in this way when in LM.</P>
    <P>If not in LM, use this command to store a eucentric focus value for the current 
      magnification.&nbsp; The script command &#39;SetEucentricFocus&#39; can be used to return 
      to this focus value, and again it will use the value from the nearest nonLM mag 
      if there is not one at the current mag.&nbsp; However, on an FEI scope, a 
      warning will appear in the log when this substitution occurs. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;If you need to replace existing calibrations, see the entries for 
      &#39;StandardLowMagFocus&#39; near the end of the SerialEMcalibrations.txt file to 
      determine which magnifications were calibrated previously.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_stemfocusvsz"></A><B>STEM Focus Vs. Z command 
          (Calibration - Focus &amp; Tuning sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to calibrate the relationship between defocus change in STEM 
        mode and a change in physical Z height.&nbsp; On the JEOL the relationship is 
        close to linear and you will use the output to set a value for the property 
        STEMdefocusToDeltaZ.&nbsp; On an FEI scope, the relationship is nonlinear and 
        may even be specific to the spot size, so the curve from this routine will be 
        stored as a calibration.&nbsp; The program will step through a range in Z, 
        autofocusing at each step, and smooth the curve at the end by averaging over 
        successive sets of three measurements. You need to have a specimen and imaging 
        conditions under which autofocusing works well.&nbsp; You should also make sure 
        the stage is at the eucentric height.&nbsp; When you select the command, you 
        will make entries to two dialog boxes:</P>
    <ol>
      <li>Total Z range over which to measure focus.&nbsp; The program will step from 
        half this range below the current Z to half this range above 1.</li>
      <li>Number of Z levels to measure focus at.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      When the routine is done, it reports the slope over the whole set of smoothed 
      points, and over the lower, middle and upper halves.&nbsp; For a JEOL, the slope 
      over the whole curve might be the best value to use for STEMdefocusToDeltaZ.&nbsp; 
      For an FEI scope, you should also enter this property, using the slope over the 
      middle of the curve.</p>

      <i>On the Hitachi HT7700</i>, use this command to record the objective lens 
      values at each magnification in HR and HC modes, and the intermediate 1 lens 
      value at each magnification in LM mode.&nbsp; When changing between 
      magnifications, the microscope changes the focus lens value by a certain amount; 
      this calibration is needed so that SerialEM can subtract off such changes and 
      show a constant defocus when magnification changes.</p>

      <A name="hid_focustuning_ctf"></A><B>Astigmatism by CTF command
        (Calibration - Focus &amp; Tuning sub-menu)</B></p>
    <p>
      Use this command to obtain a calibration for correcting astigmatism by CTF 
      fitting to images with Thon rings.&nbsp; The program will measure the amount of 
      astigmatism induced by setting the X and Y objective stigmators to positive and 
      negative values.&nbsp; The images used for calibration should satisfy the 
      various criteria described in <a href="menu_focus.htm#autotuning_by_ctf">
      Autotuning by CTF Fitting</a>.&nbsp; The calibration should be done at a fairly 
      high magnification for more accurate fitting (e.g., pixel size around 0.25 nm).&nbsp; 
      The defocus should be -1.5 to -2.5 microns.</p>
    <p>
      The stigmator change should be set so as to get 
        an astigmatism value of ~0.8 microns values from the CTF fitting.&nbsp; The easiest way to determine 
      this is just to run the calibration and see how big the &#39;astig&#39; value is after the 
        first fit with stigmation applied.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then use the
      <a href="#hid_autofocusfocus_setupastigmatism">Setup Astigmatism</a> command to 
      change the stigmator value to achieve the desired defocus change instead.&nbsp; If 
        the calibration gives astigmatism that cannot be fit (a non-elliptical pattern) 
        then use that command to reduce the value by a factor of ~3.&nbsp; The default 
        is 0.04 as of SerialEM 3.7.6, 6/12/19.&nbsp;&nbsp; These values have been found 
        useful for FEI scopes: 0.1 for Tecnais, 0.3 for Krios, 0.3 for a Glacios, 0.5 
        for a Talos 120C. Once an appropriate value is determined, the default 
      value can be set with the second entry to the property &#39;AstigmatismParams&#39;.</p>

      <A name="hid_autofocusfocus_astigmati"></A><B>Astigmatism by BTID command
        (Calibration - Focus &amp; Tuning sub-menu)</B></p>
    <p>
      Use this command to obtain a calibration for correcting astigmatism 
      by beam-tilt induced displacements.&nbsp; The 
      program will measure the relationship between settings of the objective 
      stigmator and the amount of shift in the image induced by beam tilt in two 
      different directions.&nbsp; It also needs to measure these shifts for a known 
      focus change.&nbsp; It starts by measuring the current defocus, then it measures 
      the beam-tilt induced shift at focus levels above and below a middle focus 
      value.&nbsp; It returns to the middle focus value and measures beam-tilt induced 
      shift for positive and negative changes in the X and Y stigmators.&nbsp; 
      Matrices are computed from these measurements.</p>
    <p>
      Since the measurements are similar to what occurs with autofocusing, the Focus 
      parameters are used.&nbsp; There should be a specimen with some features in it; 
      the beam intensity and exposure should be high enough to give clean images and 
      accurate autofocusing.</p>
    <p>
      Several parameters need to be in the right range to get an accurate calibration:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Magnification should be high enough to get substantial shifts.&nbsp; The 
        unbinned pixel size should be at most 0.5 nm for phosphor-based cameras at 
        200-300 KV, or at most 1 nm otherwise (&lt; 200 KV or direct detectors).&nbsp; You 
        may want to calibrate at a magnification where this is the case, plus one about 
        3 times higher.&nbsp; Focus images can be binned by 4 for phosphor-based cameras 
        at 200-300 KV or by 2 otherwise; results may be slightly more accurate with half 
        that binning.</li>
      <li>Beam tilt for the calibration should be about twice that used for 
        autofocusing, or about 3 milliradians.&nbsp; This may require removal of the 
        objective aperture.&nbsp; It is possible to use a smaller beam tilt for 
        astigmatism correction; e.g., one the same as for autofocusing.&nbsp; Beam tilt 
        is set with the <a href="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_setastigbeamtilt">Set Astig 
        Beam Tilt</a> command in the Focus menu.&nbsp; On non-FEI scopes, the entry box 
        for beam tilt will report the scaling from percent of full-scale beam tilt to 
        milliradians, estimated from focus calibrations.&nbsp; Divide the desired beam 
        tilt by the scaling and round to the nearest 0.1 to get the percentage value to 
        enter.</li>
      <li>The amount to change the stigmators needs to be large enough to get sizable 
        differences in beam-tilt induced shift, but not unrealistically large.&nbsp; See 
          the section above for values that should work on &nbsp;some FEI scopes.&nbsp; On non-FEI scopes, or if 
        you want to check the effect of a value on an FEI scope, use the following 
        script:<br />
        ReportObjectiveStigmator<br />
        stigx = $repVal1<br />
        stigy = $repVal2<br />
        newx = $stigx + 0.1<br />
        SetObjectiveStigmator $newx $stigy<br />
        Delay 2<br />
        F<br />
        SetObjectiveStigmator $stigx $stigy<br />
        <br />
        For this to work, you will need a specimen and conditions that give good Thon 
        rings in an FFT.&nbsp; Autofocus and go to 1 to 2 microns underfocus, then run 
        the script.&nbsp; Compute the FFT and click at the first minimum along the minor 
        axis of the ellipse to measure the maximum defocus, and along the major axis to 
        measure the minimum defocus.&nbsp; The difference should be 0.7 - 1 microns.&nbsp; 
          (If you have the option for CTF fitting turned on, click at the first minimum 
          midway between the axes and use the &#39;astig&#39; value that it reports.)&nbsp; Adjust the value &#39;0.1&#39; in the script to achieve this.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Calibrations are stored separately for different magnifications, probe mode on 
      an FEI, or alpha on a JEOL.&nbsp; The
      <a href="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_correctastigmatism">Correct Astigmatism</a> 
      routine will chose a calibration from the nearest magnification with a matching 
      probe mode or alpha.</p>
    <p>
      After determining beam tilt or stigmator values different from the default, add 
      a property <a href="about_properties.htm#AstigmatismParams">AstigmatismParams</a> 
      with those values; the beam tilt will then become the default for other users 
      unless they set their own values.</p>
    <p>
      The first time that an astigmatism calibration is run on a particular scope, the 
      adequacy of the delay after changing astigmatism should be checked.&nbsp; Run

      at the highest magnification that you plan to calibrate.&nbsp; The shift and 
      drift in unbinned pixels will be reported for each measurement of beam-tilt 
      induced shift, along with the &#39;operation&#39; index after &#39;oper&#39; and direction index 
      atfer &#39;dir&#39;.&nbsp; Inadequate delay will show up as higher drift for direction 0 
      on operations 2, 3, 4, and 5.&nbsp; If this is the case, add a property 
      <a href="about_properties.htm#AstigmatismComaDelays">AstigmatismComaDelays</a>
      with a delay higher than the default of 900 msec and try again. A more unlikely 
      problem is inadequate delay after changing focus, which will show up as higher 
      drift for direction 0 on operations 0, 1 and 2.&nbsp; A second value on the
      <a href="about_properties.htm#AstigmatismComaDelays">AstigmatismComaDelays</a> 
      property can be used to set a delay higher than the default of 500 msec.</p>

      The program will ask for the amount to change the objective stigmators, the 
      middle focus at which to vary astigmatism, and the total focus range over which

    <p>
      Use this command to calibrate how beam tilt must be changed to achieve coma-free 
      alignment when an image shift is imposed.&nbsp; The program will ask you what 
      image shift extent to calibrate, and then run the
      <a href="menu_focus.htm#ID_FOCUS_COMA_BY_CTF">Coma-free Alignment by CTF</a> 
      routine to measure the beam tilt needed at four locations, image shifted in +/-X 
      and +/-Y by the given amount.&nbsp; The calibration can then be applied by the 
      multi-shot routine (see <a href="navigator.htm#ID_OPTIONS_SETMULTI">Set 
      Multi-Shot Parameters</a>) and with several other script commands.</p>
    <p>
      It is important to realize that this calibration strictly applies only under the 
      current illumination conditions (specifically, the C2/C3 lens setting or 
      illuminated area).&nbsp; When near parallel illumination, it may not change much 
      with beam changes; otherwise it might change considerably.&nbsp; This has 
      several consequences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It may be necessary to do the calibration once per session, after setting up 
        the illumination to be used for acquisition.</li>
      <li>The calibration should be done in Low Dose mode if acquisition is to be done 
        in Low Dose mode</li>
      <li>Because it depends on your settings for illumination, the calibration will be 
        saved in your settings file, not shared with others using other settings files.</li>
      <li>The calibration can be checked with a script like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; FixComaByCTF<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ImageShiftByMicrons 2 0 1 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Delay 3<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; FixComaByCTF 1 1<br />
        where you could omit the first FixComaByCTF if you have already done the 
        coma-free alignment, the &quot;2 0&quot; can be replaced by an image shift of your choice, 
        and you could add additional tests at other image shift positions.&nbsp; Such a 
        script could be used to explore how much the adjusted beam tilt gets off when 
        the beam intensity is changed.</li>

      <A name="hid_autofocusfocus_coma"></A><B>BTID Coma-free Alignment command
        (Calibration - Focus &amp; Tuning - Old Coma-free Alignment sub-menu)</B></p>
    <p>
      Use this command to obtain a calibration for running the
      <a href="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_coma">Coma-free Alignment by BTID</a> routine, which 
      will adjust beam tilt to near zero by measuring beam-tilt induced displacements.&nbsp; 
      This method should no longer be used; it has been superceded by the more 
      accurate <a href="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_coma_by_ctf">Coma-free Alignment by CTF</a> 
      routine.</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;The calibration involves measuring the 
      difference between beam-tilt induced displacements at various beam tilt 
      misalignments away from the current setting.&nbsp; From differences at negative 
      and positive misalignments, it computes a matrix based on differences of these 
      differences.&nbsp; It is thus particularly important for the displacements to be 
      measured accurately, which means this procedure needs to be done with a large 
      beam tilt and at fairly high magnification.&nbsp; Another important point is 
      that the coma-free alignment must use displacements with the same beam tilt as 
      for a calibration.&nbsp; With regard to the parameter settings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The maximum beam tilt needs to be at least 10 milliradians; ~15 may give 
        better results; higher than this may be counterproductive.&nbsp; This beam tilt 
        is set&nbsp; with the <a href="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_setcomabeamtilt">Set 
        Coma Beam Tilt</a> command in the Focus menu.&nbsp; If there are existing 
        calibrations, the entry box will show their beam tilt values, so that one can 
        pick an existing value.&nbsp; Otherwise, on non-FEI scopes, the entry box will 
        report the scaling from percent of full-scale beam tilt to milliradians, 
        estimated from focus calibrations.&nbsp; Divide the desired beam tilt by the 
        scaling and round to the nearest 0.1 to get the percentage value to enter.
      </li>
      <li>The magnification needs to be high enough so that the unbinned pixel size is 
        no more than 0.15 nm for phosphor-based cameras at 200-300 KV, or no more than 
        0.3 nm otherwise (&lt; 200 KV, or direct detectors).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     As for astigmatism calibration, the Focus parameters are used.&nbsp; There 
      should be a specimen with some features in it; the beam intensity and exposure 
      should be high enough to give clean images and accurate autofocusing.</p>
    <p>
      The objective aperture needs to be removed for the calibration procedure.&nbsp; 
      The <a href="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_coma">Coma-free Alignment</a> routine will 
      use only half the maximum beam tilt reached in the calibration, so it may be 
      possible to run that with the objective aperture in, if it is large enough and 
      well-centered.&nbsp; Calibrations can be stored with different beam tilts even 
      at the same magnification, if there is a need to run the alignment with 
      different beam tilts in different situations.&nbsp; Calibrations are stored 
      separately for different magnifications, probe mode on an FEI, or alpha on a 
      JEOL.&nbsp; The <a href="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_coma">Coma-free Alignment</a> routine will 
      chose a calibration from the nearest magnification with a matching beam tilt and 
      matching probe mode or alpha.</p>
    <p>
      After determining a beam tilt different from the default, add a property
      <a href="about_properties.htm#ComaParams">ComaParams</a> with that value; the 
      beam tilt will then become the default for other users unless they set their own 
      values.</p>
    <p>
      The first time that a coma-free calibration is run on a particular scope, the 
      adequacy of the delay after changing beam tilt should be checked.&nbsp; Run 
      Calibrate - Set Debug Output and enter c, then run the coma-free calibration at 
      the highest magnification that you plan to calibrate.&nbsp; The shift and drift 
      in unbinned pixels will be reported for each measurement of beam-tilt induced 
      shift, along with an &#39;operation&#39; index after &#39;oper&#39;.&nbsp; Inadequate delay will 
      show up as high drift values, particularly for the operations that involve the 
      greatest initial beam tilt (0, 4, 5, and 7).&nbsp;&nbsp; If drift is high, the 
      delay can be increased from its default of 500 msec with the third value in the 
      property <a href="about_properties.htm#AstigmatismComaDelays">
      AstigmatismComaDelays</a> (if you have to add the property, use the defaults for 
      the first two delays).</p>
    <p>
      To assess the precision of the calibration, you should run it twice under the 
      same conditions.&nbsp; The program will always report the mean and maximum 
      difference between a previous and new calibration, averaged over the 8 matrix 
      terms of the calibration and expressed as a percentage of the largest term.&nbsp; 
      It is probably best to get a mean and maximum of 5 and 10%, respectively, or 
      less.&nbsp; The two ways to reduce these errors are to increase the 
      magnification and the beam tilt; the latter will have a bigger effect.</p>

      <P>This command allows a calibration of the condenser lens setting for beam crossover at each 
        spot size. This calibration is needed in order to maintain beam intensity 
        calibrations on both sides of crossover. In addition, this calibration should 
        be done before the beam and spot intensity calibrations because the crossover 
        value is stored when those calibrations are done. If the beam crossover 
        changes, which can occur as a result of some alignment procedures on FEI scopes, then 
        rerunning this calibration will adjust the C2 settings appropriately in the 
        beam and spot calibrations. First make sure you are at eucentric focus. 
        Go to a high magnification where crossover can be 
        visualized easily. After you select the command, the program will cycle though 
        the spot sizes and ask you to bring the beam to crossover at each.</P>
    <P><i>For a Titan microscope,</i> you will be asked to enter the size of the C2 
      aperture after running this command.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_beamintensity"></A><B>Beam Intensity command (Calibration 
          - Beam &amp; Spot sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will calibrate beam intensity for the current spot size, starting 
        at the current intensity and going down to intensities needed at magnifications 
        below 10000x. SerialEM uses these calibrations to change intensity by a desired 
        amount rather than to achieve an absolute intensity level. The range of 
        magnifications is needed so that the program can use the calibrations to set 
        intensity properly when going to low magnification during various procedures. 
        This is preferable to simply relying on the intensity zoom feature. The Beam 
        Crossover calibration should be up to date before this calibration is done.</P>
      <P>To prepare a calibration, start with the brightest beam that anyone might need 
        calibrations for. For example, go to the highest magnification that might be 
        used for tilt series, and condense the beam until it is slightly bigger than 
        the field of the CCD camera. For an extra margin of safety, you could start one 
        or two magnification steps higher. Also, if the beam is too bright when 
        condensed that much, you can start at a higher magnification and with the beam 
        spread more. Another reason to start at a higher magnification is if the beam is 
        not very uniform; for a non-FEG microscope, you are probably better off 
        spreading the beam at least as large as the screen. Select this command to start the procedure, then check that the 
        beam is still centered. (On FEI scopes, the C1 lens (spot size) is normalized, 
        which can affect the beam size and position). The program will determine an 
        appropriate binning for short exposures, then take images with successively 
        lower intensity, increasing the binning, decreasing the magnification, and 
        increasing the exposure time as needed to cover a very wide range of intensity. 
        Do this procedure without a specimen in place.</P>
      <P>In Administrator Mode, the program will output the calibration table for each 
        magnification, consisting of the number of unbinned camera counts per second at 
        the starting magnification, and a C2 setting. The third number on each line is 
        the number of retries before getting a current in the right range at each step. 
        If the latter is more than 1 a lot of times, or if the calibration fails, the 
        first recourse is to increase the property BeamCalSpacingFactor to 1.2.&nbsp; If images appear saturated, you may need to adjust the maximum number of 
        counts, or the minimum exposure time. For information on these and other 
        properties controlling the procedure, see <A href="about_properties.htm#beamcal_properties">
          Beam intensity calibration properties</A></P>
    <P><i>If you have a K2/K3 camera</i>, the preferred option is to do intensity calibrations 
      on a different camera.&nbsp; If you must use the K2/K3, then at least the higher 
      spot sizes may require a change of properties to the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; BeamCalMinExposure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; BeamCalMaxExposure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.4<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; BeamCalMinCounts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10000<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; BeamCalInitialIncrement&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.0002<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; BeamCalSpacingFactor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2
      <br />
      For SerialEM 3.7 as of May 28, 2018, the first four are set automatically, and 
      the property values are ignored.&nbsp; In addition, this version will use 
      counting mode when the starting dose rate is below 20 electrons/unbinned 
      pixel/sec (or 75 on a K3 camera).</P>
    <P>For the weakest spots, you must be sure to condense the beam to be 
      tight around the field of view of the camera before starting, so that you are 
      working with as bright a beam as possible when starting.&nbsp; The problem with 
      the K2 (and the K3 to lesser extent) is that the noise becomes too big once the beam gets weak, so the 
      procedure has to be run in a way that keeps dropping the magnification instead 
      of making the beam much weaker.&nbsp; Using counting mode where possible 
      alleviates this problem.</P>
    <P><i>For a Ceta camera,</i> noise is also a problem when the counts get low. 
      Modify the properties to the following, adding the last one to make the 
      calibration routine behave as it does for a K2/K3:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; BeamCalMinExposure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.1<br />

    <P><i>For a Titan microscope,</i> you will be asked to enter the size of the C2 
      aperture after running this command.&nbsp; SerialEM uses the illuminated area 
      readout as an intensity measure, and the microscope scales this readout by the 
      aperture size.&nbsp; Thus, intensity calibrations are valid only if the program 
      knows both what aperture size the calibration was obtained at, and what the 
      current aperture size is. Use the  <A href="#hid_calibration_set_aperture_size">
      Set Aperture Size</A> command to inform the program when the C2 aperture has 
      changed. </P>
    <P>If you have existing calibrations from before this feature was added to keep 
      track of the aperture, you can edit the SerialEMcalibrations.txt file to insert 
      the aperture size if you know it.&nbsp; Look for each line starting with 
      'BeamIntensityTable'.&nbsp; If the line has 5 numbers then the mag, you can 
      insert the aperture size (in microns, without a decimal point) just before the 
      mag.&nbsp; If the line has 6 numbers then the mag and the last one before the 
      mag is 0, you can replace the 0 with the aperture size.&nbsp; Also, if you know 
      the aperture size at which the crossover calibration was done and there is no 
      line with 'CrossCalAtC2Aperture', you should add a line with 
      'CrossCalAtC2Aperture' followed by the aperture size.&nbsp; Finally, if you know 
      the aperture with which the spot intensity calibration was done and there is no 
      line with 'SpotCalAtC2Aperture', you should add a line with 
      'SpotCalAtC2Aperture' followed by the aperture size <i>listed twice</i>, once 
      for each side of crossover.</P>

      <P>This command will measure the relative intensity of the different spot sizes. 
        With this information, the program can take a dose calibration done at one spot 
        size and use it to compute the dose at another spot size. The procedure will 
        take pictures with the Trial parameter set, starting at the brightest spot that 
        you choose and 
        working down to the dimmest spot that you specify, without changing the other condenser lens. 
        Before you start it, you need to spread the beam to about the size of the 
        screen, then go to the brightest spot to be calibrated and set the Trial exposure so that it gives counts 
        about 1/2 to 2/3 of saturation. Then step through the spot sizes and make sure 
        the beam stays on the field of the camera -- if not, spread the beam some more. 
        When you select this command on an FEI scope, the first condenser lens (spot 
        size) will be normalized, so you should then check the centering and size of 
        the beam before confirming that the procedure can be started.</P>
    <P><i>With a K2/K3 camera,</i> again, use a different camera instead if possible.&nbsp; 
      Otherwise, set the Trial parameters for an unbinned exposure in Linear mode.&nbsp; 
      The procedure should work well enough if there is still ~1 electron per unbinned 
      pixel per second in an image with the dimmest spot, and if the intensity setting 
      needed for this does not saturate the camera on spot 1.&nbsp; Try a 1 second 
      exposure.&nbsp;&nbsp; If possible, verify with a specimen in place that an image 
      with ~20,000 counts (~40,000 with no division by 2) on spot 1 does not get 
      saturated.&nbsp; Then set the beam for that many counts with no specimen in 
      place and see if it works down to the dimmest spot.&nbsp; Run the procedure.</P>

        this is 2-3 times the diameter of the smallest circle on the screen). Take a 
        Trial exposure to verify this, and adjust exposure time or spot size to prevent 
        CCD saturation. Then select this command to perform the calibration. Seven 
        pictures will be taken: one at the starting position, two with small movements 
        of the X and Y beam shifts, and four with larger movements in both directions 
        from center.</P>
    <P>On all microscopes, the beam shift calibration is stored separately for LM and 
      non-LM modes.&nbsp; On the JEOL, calibrations are stored separately for GIF 
      mode, for different magnification ranges separated by image shift boundaries, 
      and for different alpha values.</P>

        Beam &amp; Spot sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to calibrate the factors that SerialEM needs to convert from 
        the beam intensity values available to it into values matching the C2 lens 
        percentage reported in the Microscope User Interface on FEI scopes not 
        using illuminated area for intensity. Without this calibration, C2 
        values shown in the Low Dose control panel and in the electron dose calibration 
        procedure will not match values shown by the scope. First be sure that you 
        have a C2 lens readout in your MUI workspace. Then activate the command and 
        type in the value shown in the C2 readout for each spot size.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_alpha_beam_shifts"></A><B>Alpha Beam Shifts command 
          (Calibration - Beam &amp; Spot sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to calibrate how much beam shift and beam tilt needs to be changed when going
       between two low dose areas with different alpha settings on a JEOL.&nbsp; The 
        program will go to a series of alpha settings, starting with the lowest, and ask 
        you to center the beam at each alpha, and adjust the beam tilt if desired.&nbsp; 
        First, you specify the number of alpha values to calibrate.&nbsp; If you enter 
        0, this will wipe out any existing calibrations.&nbsp; Adjust the beam at each alpha setting, and press <b>OK</b>.&nbsp; 
        If you press <b>Cancel</b>, beam shifts and tilts will be saved up to but excluding the 
        current alpha setting.&nbsp; You do not need to be in Low Dose mode to run this procedure.</P>
    <P>When going between two Low Dose modes with different alpha settings, the 
      difference in calibrated beam shift and tilt between those two alphas will be applied.&nbsp; 
      Small remaining beam shifts can then be compensated using the beam offset 
      feature in Low Dose mode.&nbsp; Additional small beam tilts can be compensated 
      as well if the property 'LowDoseBeamTiltShifts' is set.</P>
    <P>These calibrated changes will be applied a similar fashion in two situations 
      when using the Navigator: 1) when using Realign to Item in the Navigator to 
      realign to a map originally taken in low dose mode, and 2) when taking an Anchor 
      map where the map marked as &quot;For anchor state&quot; was taken in low dose mode.</P>
    <P><A name="hid_beamspot_spotbeamshifts"></A><B>Spot Beam Shifts command 
          (Calibration - Beam &amp; Spot sub-menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to calibrate the beam shifts needed to keep the beam centered 
      when changing spots.&nbsp; This calibration is essential on the Hitachi HT7700 
      and it might be useful elsewhere.&nbsp; For Hitachi, this calibrations has to be 
      done separately for HC and HR modes; on a JEOL, it has to be done separately for 
      MAG and SAMAG modes if SAMAG is defined as a secondary magnification mode.&nbsp; 
      Thus, when you run the calibration, it will be done for the current mode of the 
      microscope. The program will proceed from dim to 
      bright spots, starting at the spot number that you specify after selecting the 
      command.&nbsp; At each spot, it will ask you to confirm that you have centered 
      the beam.&nbsp; You need not go all the way to the brightest spot; if you press 
      Cancel instead of OK, it will not record a shift for the current spot size.&nbsp; 
      Any existing calibrations will be lost; calibrations will be stored only between 
      the starting and ending spot.&nbsp; When changing spot size between two sizes 
      and a calibration exists at both, the program will apply the difference in 
      recorded beam shifts to correct the beam position after the spot change.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_set_aperture_size"></A><B>Set Aperture Size command 
        (Calibration menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to inform the program of the current size of the C2 aperture 
      on a Titan microscope, where the illuminated area read from the microscope and 
      used for intensity is scaled by this aperture size when the aperture is changed.&nbsp; 
      The program will scale the intensity values in the beam intensity, spot 
      intensity, and crossover calibrations so that they are valid for this aperture 
      size.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the aperture size is set either with this command or&nbsp; 
      after one of those calibrations, it will be remembered between sessions in the 
      short term calibration file.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_electrondose"></A><B>Electron Dose command (Calibration 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to calibrate electron dose for a particular spot size. This 
        calibration is automatically saved in a special short-term calibration file and 
        is only good for a limited period of time (1 day). The calibration requires 
        that beam intensity be calibrated and that the SerialEMproperties.txt file 
        contain an entry for CountsPerElectron for the CCD camera. Before activating 
        the command, take an image of the blank beam with a reliable exposure time 
        (e.g., 0.2 seconds). Select the command and press OK. The program will report 
        the dose rate (electrons per square Angstroms per second) of the current beam 
        intensity.</P>
      <P>The dose calibration will be most accurate if the spot size is normalized (on 
        an FEI scope). To do this, open the Normalizations panel in the Microscope User 
        Interface, select TEM Spotsize, and check Spotsize. Then change spot size to 
        get a normalized beam, take a picture, and calibrate the dose with it. By the 
        same token, the actual measurement of dose at a particular beam setting will be 
        more accurate if the spot size is normalized whenever you change spot sizes. 
        Hysteresis in the second condenser lens will also reduce the accuracy of a dose 
        measurement, but this is more difficult to control for.</P>
      <P>The dose calibration is specific to the side of beam crossover on which the 
        calibration image was taken. Once a calibration is present, the program can 
        compute the dose for any image acquisition when beam intensity is within the 
        calibrated range, taking into account drift settling time as well as CCD 
        exposure time. If relative spot intensities have been calibrated, then a 
        calibration at a single spot size will allow dose to be computed at any spot 
        size. Note that dose is automatically calibrated when you take a gain 
        reference, unless you deselect this option in the <A href="hidd_gainreference.htm">Gain 
          Reference dialog</A> .</P>
      <P>When there is an electron dose calibration, the estimated dose at the specimen will be displayed in several 
        places:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>
        The dose for a low dose acquisition area will appear in the upper right of the 
        Low Dose control panel, with a continuous readout if 'Continuous update' is 
        selected.

        <LI>
          When a direct electron detector is the selected camera, the dose rate at the 
          specimen, per unbinned pixel per second, will appear in the Options portion of 
          the <a href="hidd_scopestatus.htm">Microscope Status panel</a>.</LI></OL>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_purgeoldcalibs"></A><B>Purge Old Calibs command 
          (Calibration menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will remove any dose calibrations done before the current instance 
        of the program was started. You would use this if you do a dose calibration (or 
        take a gain reference) and then want to remove any earlier calibrations. Dose 
        calibrations older than 24 hours are ignored when the program starts. Also, 
        when dose is calibrated, other calibrations older than 12 hours are then 
        removed.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_distortion"></A><B>Distortion command (Calibration menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will allow you to capture a pair of images that can be used for 
        measuring the microscope distortion field with programs in IMOD. The pairs can overlap side by side, 
        top to bottom, or diagonally. The direction of overlap is specified by a number 
        from 0 to 7. Directions 4 to 7 are equivalent to directions 0 to 3, so you just 
        need to use directions 0 to 3 to obtain a complete set of the different kinds 
        of overlapping pictures that will give twice as much data as unknowns when 
        solving for a distortion field.</P>
      <P>Before starting, center the specimen on an area that has rich image information 
        throughout. Set up Record parameters for fairly high counts in images binned to 
        1Kx1K. Select the command and specify a direction for the pairs. The program 
        will offer to set image shift to zero if you have not done so already. Then it 
        will proceed to take overlapping image pairs with stage movement between the 
        two images of a pair, until it acquires a pair with overlap within acceptable 
        limits. It will try ten times. If it fails, just try again, perhaps moving to a 
        new area.</P>
    <P>At high magnification, addition delay time after moving the stage may be 
      needed.&nbsp; This can be imposed by setting the property &#39;DistortionStageDelay&#39; 
      to the desired value in milliseconds, which will replace the default delay time 
      set by the property &#39;StageMoveDelay&#39;.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_setoverlaps"></A><B>Set Overlaps command (Calibration menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command allows you to set the limits within which overlap factors must fall 
        for the distortion pairs. You might need to expand the range of acceptable 
        overlaps if you are trying to get pairs at a high magnification. Images 
        arranged side by side or one on top of the other must meet three criteria. The 
        overlap factor in the direction separating the images must fall between a 
        minimum and a maximum value, and the overlap in the perpendicular direction 
        must exceed a high minimum value. There are two separate criteria for images 
        arranged diagonally: the minimum and maximum overlap factors, which must be met 
        separately in X and Y. If you need to change these factors, try to expand the 
        maxima more than you reduce the minima.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_magenergyshifts"></A><B>Mag Energy Shifts command 
          (Calibration menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to calibrate how much the zero loss peak shifts in energy when 
        changing magnification. This calibration involves taking many pictures with the 
        Trial parameter set. This procedure should be run with a uniform beam, i.e., no 
        specimen. For the calibration, do the following:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>
        Adjust the Trial parameters to give a quick picture with a moderate number of 
        counts; for example, center 1/2 area, binned to 256x256, with an exposure that 
        gives 4000 counts for a 15-bit 2K camera.
        <LI>
        Align the Zero loss peak at a mid-range magnification.
        <LI>
        Switch to Administrator mode to run the procedure from low to high then high to 
        low mag, for the most accurate results.
        <LI>
        Start the calibration and respond to the series of dialog boxes. First specify 
        the highest mag that should be calibrated. The default is to do 13 mags 
        starting with the lowest mag in M mode.
        <LI>
        Specify the total energy range that will be scanned for the location of the 
        zero loss peak. The default should work unless you have big energy shifts.
        <LI>
          Specify the step in energy for scanning the energy range, and the slit width. 
          The defaults should work.</LI></OL>
      <P>At each mag, the program will scan through the range of energies and measure the 
        intensity of the image, finding the center of the energy range that lets the 
        beam through unimpaired. You should see images with very low counts at least at 
        the beginning of each scan (the program will stop a scan when it decides that 
        it has seen the peak). If you do not, you may need to redo the procedure with a 
        bigger scan range.</P>
      <P>Remember to save your calibrations.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_listmags"></A><B>List Mags command (Calibration menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will cycle through all of the available microscope magnifications 
        and print in the Log Window the magnification index, the film magnification, and 
        the image rotation as reported by an FEI scope (or a 0 for a JEOL). These numbers 
        are listed in the form required for the magnification table in the 
        SerialEMProperties.txt file. Different numbers will be output in EFTEM mode than 
        in normal lens mode. <i>On an FEI scope</i> in EFTEM mode, the normal mode 
        magnification and rotation will be printed on each line before the EFTEM values, 
        so that the full table can be pasted directly into the properties file.&nbsp; 
        However, make sure that the table entries for normal mode are correct before 
        adding the EFTEM values.&nbsp; If necessary, correct the table for normal mode 
        and add the screen down magnifications (if they differ), then restart SerialEM 
        with the corrected properties file.&nbsp; Then run this command in EFTEM mode to 
        get the EFTEM table combined with the correct one for normal mode.</P>
    <P><i>On a JEOL</i>, the magnification table is followed by a table 
        of camera lengths, which is needed for the program to interpret diffraction mode 
        correctly. This table should be cut and pasted into the properties file, with 
        the first line being &#39;CameraLengthTable nn&#39;, where nn is the number of camera 
        lengths listed.&nbsp; On a JEOL, if magnifications in low mag mode are disabled 
        above a certain point, be sure to add the property 
        &#39;HighestLMindexToScan&#39; with the number of remaining enabled LM mags before 
        running this routine.</P>
    <P>In STEM mode, <i>on a JEOL</i>, the program will list all of the STEM magnifications 
      and produce a table that can be inserted into the Properties file, plus an entry 
      for LowestSTEMnonLMmag.&nbsp; <i>On an FEI</i>, STEM magnifications are not identified 
      by index values, so it is necessary to step through the magnifications with the 
      knob on the microscope.&nbsp; The program will tell you to enable &quot;LM scan&quot; in 
      the microscope STEM interface, and start at the lowest magnification that is 
      reached with that enabled.&nbsp; You can skip this if no one will ever use those 
      LM magnifications; the advantage of doing so is that it avoids having 
      magnifications whose mode cannot be determined, which will show up as &quot;S?&quot; in 
      the microscope status panel.&nbsp; You will need to step through the magnifications twice, 
      first in nanoprobe then in microprobe mode.&nbsp; At the end, the program will 
      output the table, two entries for LowestSTEMnonLMmag, and an entry for LowestMicroSTEMmag.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_neutralisvalues"></A><B>Neutral IS Values command 
          (Calibration menu)</B></P>
      <P><i>On a JEOL</i>, this command will cycle through the magnifications and measure the 
        neutral settings for image shift (or projector shift when using that for image 
        shift) at each magnification. Once these neutral 
        settings are calibrated, they will be used as a base for image shift. The 
        program will display image shift relative to the neutral value. When 
        magnification is changed, the program will try to compensate for a change in 
        neutral value and keep the actual image shift constant.&nbsp; This command needs 
        to be rerun after a service alignment that may have changed the values.&nbsp; 
        Before running the calibration, make sure that the microscope alignment panel is 
        set to User mode instead of Maintenance mode.</P>
    <P><i>On a Hitachi HT7700,</i> this command needs to be run to record the IA 
      deflector shifts in LM mode, and either the IA or PA deflectors in HR mode, 
      depending on which is being used by SerialEM for image shift there.&nbsp; (This 
      is determined by the property HitachiPAforHRmodeIS.)&nbsp; There are no fixed 
      alignment values for these deflectors; the scope just restores the value last 
      seen at a magnification when it returns to that magnification.&nbsp; Thus, 
      before running this command, you must make sure that the magnifications are 
      reasonably well aligned at least in LM mode.&nbsp; Do this without SerialEM 
      running, to ensure that no extraneous changes are imposed by SerialEM as well.&nbsp; 
      You should do the same in HR mode if the same deflectors are being used to align 
      those mags as for image shift in SerialEM. If, instead, the IA deflectors are 
      used by SerialEM for image shift and the magnifications are aligned with PA, 
      there is no conflict, but you should step through the HR magnifications and make 
      sure that IA is zeroed out.&nbsp; After the current status of the deflectors has 
      been checked, run this command to record all of their values.</P>
    <P><A name="hid_calibration_restoreneutralis"></A><B>Restore Neutral IS command

    <P>On a Hitachi HT7700, use this command to restore the deflectors used for image 
      shift in LM and HR modes to the values recorded with the
      <a href="#hid_calibration_neutralisvalues">Neutral IS Values</a> command.&nbsp; 
      This is useful if you find the magnifications misaligned, or if SerialEM has 
      left the deflectors in an inappropriate state. </P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_stagestretch"></A><B>Stage Stretch command (Calibration 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to save the most recently applied transformation of Navigator 
        points into a new registration in the calibrations. The transformation can then 
        be used to estimate the stretch in the stage coordinate system. Such an 
        estimate allows greater accuracy when transforming Navigator points using fewer 
        than 5 registration points, or after aligning rotated images in the <A href="hidd_navrotalign.htm">
          Align with Rotation dialog</A> .</P>
      <P>This command is available only if the transformation was based on a fit to at 
        least 5 registration points and contains a rotation between 70 and 110 degrees. 
        To obtain such a transformation, go to widely separated stage positions, center 
        a recognizable feature on the camera, and add either the stage position or a 
        map at each location to the Navigator table. If possible, you should mark at 
        least 6 registration points, as that will give a more robust transformation 
        than 5. Rotate the specimen by 90 degrees, find the locations again and add a 
        Navigator item at each. Mark them as registration points with the corresponding 
        values, then select the <A href="menu_navigator.htm#hid_transform_pts">Transform 
          Items command</A> in the Navigator menu. The error in the fit should be 
        only a few microns, if possible. Then select this command. The program will 
        tell you the underlying stretch implied by the transformation, and also the 
        mean magnification change contained in the transformation. The latter should be 
        very close to 1 (perhaps within 0.0005 of 1) and the stretch itself should be 
        plausible (perhaps between 0.95 and 1.05). The transformation will be stored 
        after you confirm that you want to; remember to save calibrations.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_high_defocus"></A><B>High-Defocus Mag command (Calibration 
          menu)</B></P>
          <P>Use this command to measure the change in magnification and rotation between an 
            image taken near zero focus and one at a high negative defocus.&nbsp; The 
            program can use such measurements to adjust the stage calibration when using 
            View images in Low Dose mode with a large defocus offset.&nbsp; Montaging and 
            Navigator operations can then operate accurately with such images. </P>
    <P>Using a View defocus of -100 microns or more can change the magnification by 
      5-20% and rotate images by 2-10 degrees.&nbsp; The rotation is proportional to 
      defocus but the magnification change is nonlinear, changing faster at higher 
      defocus.&nbsp; Such changes are enough to make the alignment of montage pieces 
      and the navigation to selected stage positions unreliable.&nbsp; One solution to 
      this problem is to do the stage calibration for the View magnification at the 
      desired defocus.&nbsp; However, this solution is inflexible, as it applies only 
      to that defocus and may also apply only to a narrow range of beam intensities 
      (at least on Tecnais, the magnification change depends strongly on the C2 
      setting).&nbsp; The calibration provided here avoids these problems.&nbsp; The 
      magnification change and rotation can be measured at several defocus levels and 
      a range of intensity values.&nbsp; The program can then interpolate among these 
      measurements to compute a good stage calibration anywhere within this range of 
      conditions.&nbsp; Once you get set up to run this calibration, it is relatively 
      easy and quick to run it for the different conditions.</P>
    <P>The <a href="#hid_calibration_beamcrossover">Beam Crossover</a> calibration 
      should be done before this calibration so that differences between intensities 
      can be assessed properly.</P>
    <P>To do the calibration, you need a specimen with enough image detail for good 
      correlations, and also enough exposure to give reliable correlations.&nbsp; A 
      specimen with periodic features is acceptable as long as there is not much shift 
      between the near-focus and defocused images.&nbsp; The procedure is this:</P>
    <ol>
      <li>Find an area with good non-periodic image detail.</li>
      <li>Adjust the beam to the mid-range of the anticipated intensities to be used.</li>
      <li>Adjust the exposure time to give a clean enough image for correlations.</li>
      <li>Take an image within a few microns of zero defocus.&nbsp; If you use View in 
        Low Dose mode, set the defocus offset to 0 and autofocus to the desired focus.</li>
      <li>Copy the image to the Autoalign buffer, which is shown in the 'Align To' 
        button in the Image Alignment &amp; Focus control panel.</li>
      <li>Change the focus to the first focus to be calibrated, such as -100 microns.&nbsp; 
        If you use View in Low Dose, just set the defocus offset.</li>
      <li>Take an image.&nbsp; You may need to adjust the exposure time to compensate 
        for changes in intensity.&nbsp; You may need to shift the image to show 
        approximately the same area (or very nearly the same area if there are periodic 
        features).</li>
      <li>Find two well-defined points, spaced apart by at least half the width of the 
        image, that are recognizable in each image.&nbsp; You can use the Insert and 
        Home keys in the 6-key cluster to toggle between these buffers.</li>
      <li>Draw a line between the two points in each image.&nbsp; To draw a line, hold 
        down the Shift key, depress the left mouse button with the cursor over one 
        point, drag the mouse to the other point, and release the mouse button.</li>
      <li>Run this command.&nbsp; The program will show instructions, but only once.&nbsp; 
        After you press 'Yes' to proceed, the program will do a search to refine the 
        scaling and rotation implied by the two lines.&nbsp; At the end, it will 
        transform the image in A by the scaling and rotation and toggle between the 
        near-focus image and the transformed image.&nbsp; Then it will ask you if those 
        appeared aligned.</li>
      <li>Press 'Yes' to accept the calibration, or 'No' to reject it.&nbsp; If the 
        images were not aligned, examine the lines to see if they can be improved, or 
        increase the exposure time if necessary.</li>
      <li>Change the beam intensity by a factor of two, or to one end of the range of

      <li>Change focus to the next focus level to be calibrated and repeat from step 7, 
        drawing a line between the two points in the new image.&nbsp; The low-defocus

      <li>Be sure to save the calibrations when done.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      On Tecnais, calibrations at -100, -200, -250, and -300 microns would provide 
      sufficiently accurate interpolation for any defocus down to -300.</p>
    <p>
      The calibrations are stored separately for different spot sizes, but the program 
      will simply use calibrations from the nearest spot size rather than requiring 
      one at the current spot size.&nbsp; The magnification change and rotation do not 
      vary significantly with spot size on Tecnais.&nbsp; You can start out by 
      calibrating at the brightest spot that is expected to be used for Low Dose mode, 
      and this may well be sufficient.</p>
    <p>
      Calibrations are also stored separately for nanoprobe and microprobe mode on FEI 
      scopes, and in this case only calibrations from the current mode are used.</p>
    <p>
      If you need to redo the calibrations, do them at intensities near those in the 
      existing calibrations, and the program will remove each nearby existing 
      calibration.&nbsp; There will be a message in the log window when this occurs.&nbsp; 
      Use the List Focus-Mag Cals command described next to determine the intensity 
      values to use.</p>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_listfocus"></A><B>List Focus-Mag Cals command (Calibration 
          menu)</B></P>
          <P>Use this command to list the calibrations of magnification and rotation for 
            different defocus values done with the <a href="#hid_calibration_high_defocus">
            High-Defocus Mag</a> command.&nbsp; The calibrations are sorted by defocus and 
            intensity, and the list shows the scaling of the magnification and the degrees 
            of rotation for each.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_cameratiming"></A><B>Camera Timing command (Calibration 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will take a series of pictures to determine the timing parameters 
        for the dual shuttering mode of operation with a Gatan camera, or to determine 
        the startup delay for some other types of cameras, as well as the flyback time 
        for a STEM camera. With a proper startup delay, the program can do several 
        microscope operations (image shift, stage shift, magnification change) after the 
        exposure ends. The procedure 
        uses full-field images binned to 1024x1024 pixels by default.&nbsp; For a 
        non-STEM camera, it 
        measures the mean counts in such images with 
        a relatively long exposure (default 0.4 seconds). Before running the procedure, 
        it is necessary to adjust the beam so as to give moderately high counts in such 
        an exposure without saturating the camera. This may require a relatively dim 
        beam.</P>
    <P>For a K2 Summit or K3 camera, the procedure takes super-resolution mode images, which 
      have the longest startup time.&nbsp; The mean counts do not need to be very 
      high, because the mean counts in such images are very reproducible.&nbsp; The 
      binning does not matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
      <P>When the operation is started, the program first takes several reference 
        pictures. It then varies the timing of initial blanking to find a duration that 
        will occlude about the first half of the exposure.&nbsp; Then it takes many 
        pictures (100 by default, or 40 for K2 Summit or K3) after adjusting the timing 
        parameters to give this amount of extra beam blanking; the counts in such 
        pictures indicate how long this blanking occurred during each exposure. From the 
        range of values, the program estimates values for several properties: 
        StartupDelay and ExtraBeamTime for all non-STEM cameras, plus MinimumDriftSettling and possibly BuiltInSettling for a Gatan 
        camera with two shutters.&nbsp; If the blanking apparently ended before or after 
        the exposure for some of these pictures, the 
        program will recommend rerunning the procedure with a longer exposure time.</P>
    <P><i>For a camera with the NoShutter property set</i>, the program will switch from 
      NoShutter 2 to 1 for the timing measurements.&nbsp; This means that during the 
      reference images, it will unblank before requesting the exposure and reblank 
      after the image is acquired and returned.&nbsp; During the test images, it will 
      unblank at various times after the acquisition is requested, but still not 
      reblank until the image is returned.</P>
    <P><i>For a K2 Summit camera but not K3</i>, the procedure starts with a much longer initial 
      blanking to save time.&nbsp; If this blanking is too long, a shorter value can 
      be set with the general property &#39;CalibTimingK2InitialStartup&#39;.&nbsp; Because a 
      startup delay measured in linear or counting mode with earlier versions of 
      SerialEM would be considerably shorter and can lead to problems, the program 
      will not allow post-exposure actions if the StartupDelay property is less than a 
      minimum value.&nbsp; If your camera gives a startup delay less than this limit, 
      the program will tell you that it is not safe to use and recommend setting the delay above the default 
      minimum.&nbsp; Although it is possible to add the property &#39;K2MinStartupDelay&#39; with a number 
      less than your measured delay, experience has shown that this is unreliable.&nbsp; 
      This property has no effect with a K3, where initial indications are that the 
      startup delay is much shorter and more reliable.</P>
    <P>As of SerialEM 3.7 (June 30, 2018), K2 and K3 exposures with dose fractionation will have 
      an added delay of 5 ms per frame by default (set by the camera property 
      &#39;StartDelayPerFrame&#39;).&nbsp; This addition should give reliable timing even with 
      the default minimum startup delay.&nbsp; The signs that the startup delay are 
      too short are: 
      when calibrating image shift, images after the first one may be smeared or the 
      calibration may be bad; when taking tilt series, images after the first few 
      tilts may be smeared; when saving frames during tilt series, the final frames of the exposure may 
      have excessive drift within each frame; when using the MultipleRecord script 
      command and saving frames, the frames near the end of the exposure may shift to 
      the next position.&nbsp; If turning off the Post-actions 
      option in the Camera menu solves the problem, then the StartupDelay is too 
      short.</P>
    <P>Saving frames with the MultipleRecords&nbsp;command, taking two off-center 
      shots and a center shot after them, is an efficient way to test whether the 
      startup delay, or possibly the added time per frame, is too short.&nbsp; 
      Problems will appear in the first two sets of frames.</P>
    <P><i>For a STEM camera</i>, the program does not use the mean counts in an exposure but 
      instead finds the line in the image where the beam was unblanked.&nbsp; To take 
      interpretable images, it cancels any contrast inversion or image rotation being 
      done in SerialEM.&nbsp; The default exposure time is 1.2 seconds, which helps to 
      give an accurate estimate of the flyback time (time between each line of 
      exposure).&nbsp; Fewer test images are needed to get the final estimate of 
      startup delay, so the default there is 30.&nbsp; At the end, the program will 
      recommend entries for StartupDelay and AddedFlyback.&nbsp;For DigiScan, this 
      should be a small number; it is added to the flyback time set in the DigiScan 
      interface.&nbsp; For FEI STEM, it will be a large and highly variable number, 
      and it is necessary to run the procedure described next to get a more useful set 
      of flyback times.&nbsp; The program may also recommend an entry for 
      MinimumBlankingTime, which may be needed to get the next procedure to work 
      reliably.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_quick_flyback_time"></A><B>Quick Flyback Time command 
        (Calibration menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will run the Camera Timing routine in a special rapid mode to 
        estimate the flyback time (time between successive lines) for FEI STEM with 
        particular acquisition parameters. This is necessary because the flyback time 
        for FEI STEM varies over a large range and somewhat unpredictably, depending on exposure time, binning, 
        subarea size, and to a small degree, on magnification.&nbsp; An accurate flyback 
        time is needed for dynamic focusing to work optimally.&nbsp; </P>
    <P>When you select the command, the program will ask which camera parameter set to 
      run the timing for.&nbsp; Answer with the first letter of parameter set name 
      (upper or lower case).&nbsp; The program will then run the timing routine with 
      either 3 trials at 3 startup delays or 4 trials at 4 startup delays, depending 
      on exposure time.&nbsp; At the end it will report the flyback time and startup 
      delay and ask if you want to store them in the table of timings, replacing an 
      existing value if there is one.&nbsp; When the program exits, this table is 
      automatically stored in the file SEMflybackTimes.txt in the SerialEM configuration
      directory (C:\Program Files\SerialEM or C:\ProgramData\SerialEM).&nbsp; The 
      table keeps track of the exposure time, binning, image size, magnification, and 
      date/time at which each measurement is made.</P>
    <P>The flyback time has a predictable, linear dependence on exposure time over 
      some ranges of time.&nbsp; However, there can also be a small interval within 
      such a range with values that differ from the linear relationship by 20% or 
      more.&nbsp; For example, with full-sized images binned to 1K, there are special 
      intervals at 3 and 6 seconds.&nbsp; Also, the slope of the linear relationship 
      can change between low and high exposure times.&nbsp; When doing dynamic focus 
      with a given exposure time that is not in the table, the program will attempt to 
      interpolate or extrapolate from entries in the table with nearby exposure times 
      and other conditions matching.&nbsp; It will even eliminate one outlier when 
      finding the linear relationship between flyback time and exposure time.&nbsp; 
      This estimate may be adequate over some ranges of exposure times and not good 
      enough in other regions.&nbsp; You thus have three choices: 1) use dynamic focus 
      only with parameters that have a measured flyback time and do not vary exposure 
      during a tilt series; 2) vary exposure in discrete steps where the flyback time 
      is measured (using the ability to vary parameters like exposure time during a 
      tilt series); or 3) vary exposure continuously over a range where there are no 
      special intervals.&nbsp; The second and third strategy in particular would 
      require this timing routine to be run many times.&nbsp; There is a script 
      command, 'QuickFlyback', that will run this routine and save the result 
      automatically in the table for a specified camera parameter set and an exposure 
      time that replaces the time in that set.&nbsp; For example, a script like this 
      could be used to measure a series of times at two different intervals.<br />
      <pre>
       exptime = 0.6
      interval = 0.2
      loop 15
        QuickFlyback R $exptime
        exptime = $exptime + $interval
      endloop
      interval = 0.5
      loop 10
        QuickFlyback R $exptime
        exptime = $exptime + $interval
      endloop

      <P><A name="hid_calibration_shutterdeadtime"></A><B>Shutter Dead Time command 
          (Calibration menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will take a series of pictures with very short exposure times to 
        determine the dead time of the beam shutter, namely the amount of exposure 
        lost. The calibration is needed on JEOLs because the dead time can be ~0.01 
        sec, and this can lead to incorrect shutter time changes in routines that need 
        to change the shutter time to reduce specimen exposure. Before running it, set 
        the Trial exposure to 0.1 second and adjust the beam and binning to give a 
        moderate number of counts (1/4 - 1/2 saturation). Start the routine and accept 
        the default for the starting exposure time. The program will take 7 pictures 
        with progressively longer exposures and fit a line to determine the exposure 
        that would give no counts. It will then redo the procedure, starting at 0.01 
        sec above this exposure level. At the end it will recommend an entry for 
        ShutterDeadTime in the properties of the camera in question.</P>
      <P>When there is a dead time property, the program will use this in estimating how 
        to change an exposure time when going to a lower magnification, which it may 
        have to do if the beam intensity cannot be lowered enough. The value is also 
        used when computing the dose resulting from camera exposures.</P>
