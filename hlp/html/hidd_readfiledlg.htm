    <P>This dialog opens when you use the <A HREF="menu_file.htm#hidm_file_read">Read</A>
      item in the File menu to read from the current open file and that file has more 
      than one section in it. If you just want to read one section, you can enter the 
      section number and type 'Enter' or press <B>OK</B>, and the dialog will go away 
      after the image is read. However, you can also leave the dialog open so that it 
      is convenient to read images from files. Specifically:</P>
    <P>Press <B>Read</B> to read in the section indicated in the text box and leave the 
      dialog open.
    </P>
    <P>Press <B>Next</B> to read in the next section, update the number in the text 
      box, and leave the dialog open.
    </P>
    <P>Press <B>Previous</B> to read in the previous section, update the number in the 
      text box, and leave the dialog open.
    </P>
    <P>Press <B>OK</B> to read in the selected section and close the dialog.
    </P>
    <P>Press <B>Cancel</B> to close the dialog without reading in a section.</P>
    <P>Sections are read from the current file, even if you change the current file 
      after opening this dialog. Like many other free-standing dialog boxes, this 
      dialog will be opened at the position where it was when it was last closed.</P>
