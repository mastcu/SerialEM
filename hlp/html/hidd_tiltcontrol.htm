    <P>This window displays the current tilt angle, allows one to tilt by an increment 
      or to go to a desired angle, and contains options for tilt-related parameters.</P>
    <P><B>Tilt Angle Readout</B></P>
    <P>This readout shows the current tilt angle, which should match the tilt readout in 
    the microscope user interface.</P>
    <P><B>Tilt Up</B></P>
    <P><B>Tilt Down</B></P>
    <P>These buttons will tilt toward positive or negative tilt angles by the current 
      tilt increment, which is either the basic tilt increment, or this basic 
      increment multiplied by the cosine of the tilt angle if 'Cosine increments' is 
      selected.</P>
    <P><B>Set Increment</B></P>
    <P>Use this button to set the basic tilt increment. A dialog box will appear, with 
      the current value as the default. Enter a value in degrees.</P>
    <P><B>Set Delay</B></P>
    <P>Use this button to set the delay to be applied after tilting by the basic 
      increment. A dialog box will appear, with the current value as the default. 
      Enter a value in seconds. This delay time must expire before a new image is 
      taken with the camera.&nbsp; This applies when not doing a tilt series, or when 
      doing a lower-magnification task during a tilt series (specifically, finding 
      eucentricity); a separate delay set in the <a href="hidd_tiltseries.htm">Tilt 
      Series Setup dialog</a> governs Record, 
      focusing, and other images taken during a tilt series at the working 
      magnification.</P>
    <P><B>Cosine Increments</B></P>
    <P>Use this button to select cosine tilt increments, in which the increment is 
      proportional to the cosine of the tilt angle.</P>
