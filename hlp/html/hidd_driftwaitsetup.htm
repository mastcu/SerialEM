        Wait for Drift Setup Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog allows you to set parameters for the Wait for Drift task, which 
        measures drift repeatedly until it reaches a criterion level or a time limit is 
        reached.&nbsp; These parameters are used by the DriftWaitTask script command 
        unless they are overridden by non-zero entries to the command.&nbsp; The 
        successive drift measurements are shown in the status bar.&nbsp; When measuring 
        with Focus or Trial images, the drift is also printed to the log if the Verbose 
        option is on in the Tasks menu.&nbsp; When measuring with autofocus runs, the 
        drift and elapsed time are included in each autofocus report in the log.</p>
      <p>The top part of the dialog is always present.&nbsp; The bottom part has options 
          specific to tilt series that are stored in the tilt series parameters.&nbsp; It 
          appears only when this dialog is opened from the <A HREF="hidd_tiltseries.htm">Tilt Series Setup dialog</A> 
          or when a tilt series is stopped.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Parameters Controlling the Drift Task</em></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Images to measure drift between</strong></p>
      <p>Use these radio buttons to select what kind of images to use for measuring drift.&nbsp; 
          The choices are:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Between successive Trial images, possibly with a modified exposure time and 
              binning.</li>
          <li>Between successive Focus images, using the Focus parameters.</li>
          <li>Within individual autofocus runs, using the drift estimated by the shift between 
              the first and the third image.&nbsp; Defocus will be adjusted to the target in each 
              run.&nbsp; This option should be used with caution when trying to achieve low 
              drift rates for high resolution (see note under
          <strong>Time span of drift measurements</strong>).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          For the autofocus option, the program will take 3 Focus images for 
          &#39;drift protection&#39; regardless of the setting of the option for this in the Focus 
          menu.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Change Trial parameters</strong></p>
      <p>
          Select this option to use a specified exposure time and binning whenever using 
          Trial images.&nbsp; Use the text box to set the <strong>Trial exposure </strong>
          and the spin button to set the <strong>Binning</strong>.&nbsp; Longer exposure 
          time will improve the signal-to-noise ratio and lower binning may improve the 
          accuracy of correlations somewhat, both of which should improve the accuracy of 
          the measurement.</p>
      <p>
          This option applies only to Trial images under the assumption that Focus 
          parameters should already be set to give a good signal-to-noise ratio for 
          measurement of small shifts.&nbsp; Aside from the exposure and binning, the 
          accuracy of measurements with Focus images should be improved with full-field 
          rather than subarea images.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Time span of drift measurements</strong></p>
      <p>
          Enter the time interval between the two images being correlated to measure drift 
          in the text box.</p>
      <p>
          When autofocusing, a delay will be imposed between the 
          images of the autofocus run to make the time between the first and third images 
          as long as this interval.&nbsp;&nbsp; This makes the defocus measurement more 
          vulnerable to a decay in the drift rate within the autofocus run because some of 
          the shift due to drift will be attributed to defocus instead.&nbsp; For example, 
          if the beam-tilt-induced shift is 10 pixels and drift decays from 5 pixels 
          between the first two images to 3 pixels between the second pair, then the 
          beam-tilt-induced shift will be estimated at 11, off by 10%.&nbsp; Intervals 
          long enough to increase the autofocus time substantially should be used only 
          when the shifts induced by the beam tilt are much bigger than the shift 
          attributable to drift, such as with a relatively large defocus, very high 
          magnification, or high beam tilt.&nbsp; Use <a href="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_reportshiftdrift">Report Shift &amp; Drift</a> 
          or <a href="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_reportonexisting">Report On Existing</a>, 
          or autofocus with Verbose on in the Focus/Tune menu to assess the relative 
          size of these shifts. </p>
      <p>
          The actual time span of the drift measurement 
          may be longer than this interval if the basic acquisition time is more than the 
          interval when using Trial or Focus images, or more than half the interval when 
          using autofocus runs.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Drift rate to reach</strong></p>
      <p>
          Enter the criterion (target) drift rate in the text box, in the units show after 
          the box (nm versus Angstroms).</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Maximum time to wait</strong></p>
      <p>
          Enter the maximum total time to wait for the drift to reach the target rate.</p>
    <p>
          <strong>Skip if immediately previous autofocus had drift below X</strong></p>
    <p>
          This option allows the routine to test whether an autofocus just prior to 
          running the drift waiting a drift rate low enough so that further testing can be 
          skipped.&nbsp; Because the drift measurement from this autofocus is inherently 
          less accurate if it is made over a smaller time interval than is specified here, 
          it is usually advisable to use a smaller drift value here than the final drift 
          rate that you want to reach.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Generate error if target drift rate is not reached</strong></p>
      <p>
          Select this option to have the program put up a message box and issue a general 
          stop command to anything else running when the target drift rate is not achieved 
          after the maximum wait time has elapsed.&nbsp; With the option off, the program 
          will print a failure message to the log and scripts can test for success with 
          the &#39;GetLastTaskDrift&#39; command.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Correct drift with image shift</strong></p>
      <p>
          Select this option to have image shift applied to correct for the 
          drift between each pair of successive images.&nbsp; When measuring with 
          autofocus, only the drift between the first and third image of an autofocus
           run is corrected, not the drift between the third image of one run and the 
          first of the next run.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Show Angstroms/sec instead of nm/sec</strong></p>
      <p>
          This option is here because nm/sec, used elsewhere in the program, becomes 
          awkward at low drift rates.</p>
      <p>
          <strong><em>Parameters Controlling When to Wait in Tilt Series</em></strong></p>
      <p>
          Waiting for drift is a time-consuming step and the controls here provide 
          different ways to restrict when it is run.&nbsp; It may be possible to tell that 
          an option is appropriate from the drift rates in tilt series where the step is 
          run at every tilt.&nbsp; In other cases, it might be necessary to evaluate the 
          quality of the final result in order to determine whether an option is an acceptable way to save time.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Tilt series angular restrictions</strong></p>
      <p>
          Select <strong>Run at any angle</strong> to wait for drift regardless of tilt 
          angle in a tilt series, <strong>Run only above</strong> to wait only above the 
          angle given in the text box, or <strong>Run only below</strong> to wait only 
          below the angle in its respective text box.&nbsp; Waiting for drift only above 
          an angle would be appropriate for situations where drift is much higher at high 
          tilt (such as with side-entry holders) and not a concern at lower angles (e.g., 
          if frame alignment handles the drift adequately).&nbsp; Waiting only below an 
          angle might be appropriate if the higher tilt images contribute little of the 
          high-frequency information that is impaired by drift.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Dose-symmetric series: Run only at tilt reversals</strong></p>
      <p>
          Select this option to wait for drift only after the tilt direction changes in 
          dose-symmetric series, or more specifically, to skip waiting after tilting 
          between adjacent angles on the same side of the series.&nbsp; This option would 
          be appropriate if drift is found to be low after such tilt changes.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Dose-symmetric series: Ignore angular restrictions</strong></p>
      <p>
          Select this option to wait for drift regardless of tilt angle in a 
          dose-symmetric series, even if a restriction is selected with the radio buttons 
          above.&nbsp; This option allows you to set up a different behavior for 
          dose-symmetric and other tilt series without having to revisit this dialog and 
          change the angular restriction choice.</p>
      <p>
          Suppose the option <strong>Run only below</strong> is selected with an angle X.&nbsp; 
          This matrix shows when the task will be run in a dose-symmetric series for the 
          different combinations:</p>
