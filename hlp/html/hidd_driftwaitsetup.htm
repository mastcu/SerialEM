        Wait for Drift Setup Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog allows you to set parameters for the Wait for Drift task, which 
        measures drift repeatedly until it reaches a criterion level or a time limit is 
        reached.&nbsp; These parameters are used by the DriftWaitTask script command 
        unless they are overridden by non-zero entries to the command.</p>
      <p><strong>Images to measure drift between</strong></p>
      <p>Use these radio buttons to select what kind of images to use for measuring drift.&nbsp; 
          The choices are:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Between successive Trial images, possibly with a modified exposure time and 
              binning.</li>
          <li>Between successive Focus images, using the Focus parameters.</li>
          <li>Between the last images of successive autofocus runs.&nbsp; This choice allows 
              focus to be refined at the same time as drift is measured, while still giving an 
              accurate measure of low drift rates because the time between correlated images 
              is as long as you specify.</li>
          <li>Within individual autofocus runs, using the drift estimated by the shift between 
              the first and the third image.&nbsp; This method is suitable only for measuring 
              higher drift rates, unless the time between those images is relatively long.&nbsp; 
              It is the only method that can finish in less than the time between successive 
              measurements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          For both of the autofocus options, the program will take 3 Focus images for 
          &#39;drift protection&#39; regardless of the setting of the option for this in the Focus 
          menu.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Change Trial parameters</strong></p>
      <p>
          Select this option to use a specified exposure time and binning whenever using 
          Trial images.&nbsp; Use the text box to set the <strong>Trial exposure </strong>
          and the spin button to set the <strong>Binning</strong>.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Time between drift measurements</strong></p>
      <p>
          Enter the time between successive measurements in the text box.&nbsp; When 
          measuring drift within autofocus runs, this is the interval between the start of 
          the autofocus runs; otherwise, it is the time over which drift is measured.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Drift rate to reach</strong></p>
      <p>
          Enter the criterion (target) drift rate in the text box, in the units show after 
          the box (nm versus Angstroms).</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Maximum time to wait</strong></p>
      <p>
          Enter the maximum total time to wait for the drift to reach the target rate.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Generate error if target drift rate is not reached</strong></p>
      <p>
          Select this option to have the program put up a message box and issue a general 
          stop command to anything else running when the target drift rate is not achieved 
          after the maximum wait time has elapsed.&nbsp; With the option off, the program 
          will print a failure message to the log and scripts can test for success with 
          the &#39;GetLastTaskDrift&#39; command.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Correct drift with image shift</strong></p>
      <p>
          Select this option to have image shift applied to correct for the drift between 
          each pair of successive images; this option is not available when measuring 
          within autofocuses.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Show Angstroms/sec instead of nm/sec</strong></p>
      <p>
          This option is here because nm/sec, used elsewhere in the program, becomes 
          awkward at low drift rates.</p>
