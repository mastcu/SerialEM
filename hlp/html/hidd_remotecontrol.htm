    <p>
      This panel contains various controls to minimize the need to access the
      microscope&#39;s user interface.&nbsp; Its primary use is to facilitate control
      of the microscope via remote access, but it is more generally useful in a
      variety of situations, and allows the elimination of some common scripts.&nbsp;
      This panel is unique in that it can be completely eliminated from the set of
      tool panels if desired, using an entry in the Window menu.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Open/Close Valve(s)&nbsp; or&nbsp; Turn Beam On/Off</b></p>
    <p>
      This button allows one to toggle the state of the beam: it opens or closes the
      column valves on a Thermo/FEI scope or the beam valve on a JEOL scope with a FEG, or
      it turns the filament on or off on other JEOL scopes.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Blank or Unblank</strong></p>
    <p>
      Use this button to blank or unblank the beam; the button is labeled and colored 
      to reflect the current blanking state and the action when pressed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Raise/Lower Screen</b></p>
    <p>
      Use this button to raise or lower the screen.</p>
    <p>
      <b>-&gt; nPr /&nbsp; -&gt; uPr (Thermo/FEI only)</b></p>
    <p>
      Press this button to switch to the indicated
      nanoprobe of microprobe mode.&nbsp;
      It is disabled in low magnification mode.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Alpha (JEOL only)</b></p>
    <p>
      Use this spin button to change the alpha setting; the current alpha is shown
      next to the button.&nbsp; It is disabled in low magnification mode.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Spot</b></p>
    <p>
      Use this spin button to increase or decrease the spot size number.&nbsp;
      If you click the button multiple times with a small enough time (&lt; 0.35 sec)
      between clicks, the program will go several steps with just one spot size
      change.&nbsp; If you press and hold the Ctrl key first, the change will not
      occur until you release Ctrl, or until ~2.5 seconds since the last click.&nbsp; The new spot size will be displayed in the
      <a href="hidd_scopestatus.htm">Microscope Status</a> panel as soon as you click
      the button, prefixed by '-&gt;', so that you can know what spot size will be
      reached.</p>
    <p>
      <b>C2/C3/IA and step -/+</b></p>
    <p>
      Use this spin button to increase or decrease the value of the intensity lens
      setting: the illuminated area on a Thermo/FEI Titan, C2 value on other Thermo/FEI scopes and
      Hitachi scopes, C3 value on JEOL scopes.&nbsp; The size of the change is
      indicated by the value below the label, in units of percent C2 or C3 or microns
      of illuminated area.&nbsp; This control requires no calibrations.&nbsp; The same
      changes can be made with Ctrl and the Up and Down Arrow keys, with the same step
      size.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Intensity </b></p>
    <p>
      Use these buttons to decrease or increase the step size for changes in the
      intensity lens value.&nbsp; The same changes can be made with the Ctrl and the ,
      (comma) or . (period) keys, and changes with those keys will appear in the size
      indicated here.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Beam Up/Down, Left/Right and step -/+</b></p>
    <p>
      Use these two spin buttons to move the beam
      in the indicated direction. The size of the step is indicated by the text below 
      the <strong>Beam</strong> label. </p>
    <p>
        For beam movement in imaging mode, the step is expressed as
        a percentage of the camera field of view .&nbsp; For example, a step of 10 will
        move the beam by one-tenth of the field of view of the current camera.&nbsp; The
        same movements can be made with Shift and the Arrow keys, with the same step
        size.&nbsp; If beam shift is not calibrated for the current magnification
      range, the movements will be along the beam shift deflector axes by an approximate
        amount.&nbsp; In diffraction mode, these spin buttons will move the diffraction
        pattern on the camera.&nbsp; There is no calibration for this movement.&nbsp;
        The size of the movement is controlled by the property DiffractionShiftScaling,
        which may need to be set to give a useful amount of shift for the various step
        sizes.</p>
    <p>
      For stage movement, the step is in microns, and the movement is in the direction 
      that will shift the&nbsp; If stage movement is selected, the step size will 
      change to multiples of 1, 2 or 5.</p>
    <p>
      Use the <strong>- </strong>and <strong>+ </strong>buttons to decrease or 
      increase the step size for beam movement by a factor of 1.414.&nbsp; The same 
      changes can be made with the &lt; and &gt; keys, and changes with those keys will 
      appear in the size indicated here.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>
      <b>Focus Up/Down and step -/+</b></p>
    <p>
      Use this spin button to change defocus.&nbsp; Use the <strong>- </strong>and <strong>+</strong> 
      buttons to change the step size for focus changes, which is shown in
      microns below the<strong> Focus</strong> label; available steps range from 0.01 to 100.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Stage Up/Down, Left/Right and <b>step -/+</b></strong></p>
    <p>
      Use these two spin buttons to move the stage so that the image on the current 
      camera shifts in the given direction.&nbsp; Use the <strong>- </strong>and
      <strong>+</strong> buttons to change the step size, which changes to multiples 
      of 1, 2, or 5 and is shown in microns below the <strong>Stage</strong> label.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Mag (CamL in diffraction)</b></p>
    <p>
      Use this spin button to increase or decrease the magnification
        or the camera length in diffraction mode.&nbsp;If you click the button multiple times with a small enough time (&lt; 0.35 sec)
      between clicks, the program will go several steps with just one magnification
      change.&nbsp; If you press and hold the Ctrl key first, the change will not
      occur until you release Ctrl, or until ~2.5 seconds since the last click.&nbsp; The new magnification will be displayed in the
      <a href="hidd_scopestatus.htm">Microscope Status</a> panel as soon as you click
      the button, prefixed by '-&gt;', so that you can know what magnification will be
      reached.&nbsp; The '-&gt;' will stay until the magnification change is achieved.&nbsp;
        This preview feature does not work on Thermo/FEI scopes in diffraction mode unless
        there is a CameraLengthTable entry in properties; see
        <a href="menu_calibration.htm#hid_calibration_listmags">List Mags</a> for a
        script to get such a table.</p>
    <p>
      On Thermo/FEI scopes in STEM mode, it is not possible for SerialEM to switch between LM
      and nonLM magnifications, so this button will not work at that boundary.&nbsp;
      If necessary, you can go out of STEM, change magnification to enter or leave LM,
      and then return to STEM mode.</p>
    <p>
      Hold down the Shift key when clicking the magnification spinner to have the 
      program change intensity when you change magnification with the <b>Mag</b> spin 
      button, so as to maintain a constant beam brightness.&nbsp; This is done with 
      the program&#39;s intensity calibrations, and works works regardless of whether an 
      equivalent function is turned on in the microscope user interface.&nbsp; 
      Intensity must be within the calibrated range for the current spot size.&nbsp; 
      The text &#39;&amp; C2&#39; (or whatever name applies) will appear when this change is 
      possible.&nbsp; The <b>Intensity with Mag </b>checkbox for this functionality was 
      eliminated in SerialEM 4.2, but could be restored if other options get added to 
      this panel. </p>
