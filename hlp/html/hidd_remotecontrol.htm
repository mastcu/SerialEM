    <p>
      This panel contains various controls to minimize the need to access the 
      microscope&#39;s user interface.&nbsp; Its primary use is to facilitate control 
      of the microscope via remote access, but it is more generally useful in a 
      variety of situations, and allows the elimination of some common scripts.&nbsp; 
      This panel is unique in that it can be completely eliminated from the set of 
      tool panels if desired, using an entry in the Window menu.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Open/Close Valve(s)&nbsp; or&nbsp; Turn Beam On/Off</b></p>
    <p>
      This button allows one to toggle the state of the beam: it opens or closes the 
      column valves on an FEI scope or the beam valve on a JEOL scope with a FEG, or 
      it turns the filament on or off on other JEOL scopes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Mag</b></p>
    <p>
      Use this spin button to increase or decrease the magnification.&nbsp;If you click the button multiple times with a small enough time (&lt; 0.35 sec) 
      between clicks, the program will go several steps with just one magnification 
      change.&nbsp; If you press and hold the Ctrl key first, the change will not 
      occur until you release Ctrl, or until ~2.5 seconds since the last click.&nbsp; The new magnification will be displayed in the
      <a href="hidd_scopestatus.htm">Microscope Status</a> panel as soon as you click 
      the button, prefixed by '-&gt;', so that you can know what magnification will be 
      reached.&nbsp; The '-&gt;' will stay until the magnification change is achieved.</p>
    <p>
      On FEI scopes in STEM mode, it is not possible for SerialEM to switch between LM 
      and nonLM magnifications, so this button will not work at that boundary.&nbsp; 
      If necessary, you can go out of STEM, change magnification to enter or leave LM, 
      and then return to STEM mode.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Intensity with Mag</b></p>
    <p>
      Select this option to have the program change intensity when you change 
      magnification with the <b>Mag</b> spin button, so as to maintain a constant beam 
      brightness.&nbsp; Intensity must be within the calibrated range for the current 
      spot size for this option to have any effect.&nbsp; This option works regardless 
      of whether an equivalent function is turned on in the microscope user interface 
      (intensity zoom, brightness zoom).</p>
    <p>
      <b>-&gt; nPr /&nbsp; -&gt; uPr (FEI only)</b></p>
    <p>
      Press this button to switch to the indicated 
      nanoprobe of microprobe mode.&nbsp; 
      It is disabled in low magnification mode.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Alpha (JEOL only)</b></p>
    <p>
      Use this spin button to change the alpha setting; the current alpha is shown 
      next to the button.&nbsp; It is disabled in low magnification mode.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Beam or Stage Up/Down, Left/Right</b></p>
    <p>
      Use these two spin buttons to move either the beam 
      or the stage in the indicated direction, depending on whether the &#39;B&#39; or &#39;S&#39; 
      button is depressed.&nbsp; The size of the step is indicated by the text below 
      the spin buttons and can be increased or decreased with the &#39;+&#39; and &#39;-&#39; buttons. </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;For beam movement, the step is expressed as a fraction of the camera field of view 
      .&nbsp; For example, a step of 0.1 will move the beam by one-tenth of the field 
      of view of the current camera.&nbsp; The same movements can be made with Shift 
      and the Arrow keys, with the same step size.&nbsp; Use of these 
      controls to move the beam require beam shift to be calibrated for the current magnification 
      range.</p>
    <p>
      For stage movement, the step is in microns, and the movement is in the direction 
      that will shift the image on the current camera in the given direction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Spot</b></p>
    <p>
      Use this spin button to increase or decrease the spot size number.&nbsp; 
      If you click the button multiple times with a small enough time (&lt; 0.35 sec) 
      between clicks, the program will go several steps with just one spot size 
      change.&nbsp; If you press and hold the Ctrl key first, the change will not 
      occur until you release Ctrl, or until ~2.5 seconds since the last click.&nbsp; The new spot size will be displayed in the
      <a href="hidd_scopestatus.htm">Microscope Status</a> panel as soon as you click 
      the button, prefixed by '-&gt;', so that you can know what spot size will be 
      reached.</p>
    <p>
      <b>C2/C3/IA</b></p>
    <p>
      Use this spin button to increase or decrease the value of the intensity lens 
      setting: the illuminated area on an FEI Titan, C2 value on other FEI scopes and 
      Hitachi scopes, C3 value on JEOL scopes.&nbsp; The size of the change is 
      indicated by the value below the button, in units of percent C2 or C3 or microns 
      of illuminated area.&nbsp; This control requires no calibrations.&nbsp; The same 
      changes can be made with Ctrl and the Up and Down Arrow keys, with the same step 
      size.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Beam or Stage step -/+</b></p>
    <p>
      If beam movement is selected, use these buttons to decrease or increase the step size for beam movement by a 
      factor of 1.414.&nbsp; The same changes can be made with the &lt; and &gt; keys, and 
      changes with those keys will appear in the size indicated here.&nbsp; If stage 
      movement is selected, the step size will change to multiples of 1, 2 or 5.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Intensity step -/+</b></p>
    <p>
      Use these buttons to decrease or increase the step size for changes in the 
      intensity lens value.&nbsp; The same changes can be made with the Ctrl and the , 
      (comma) or . (period) keys, and changes with those keys will appear in the size 
      indicated here.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Raise/Lower Screen</b></p>
    <p>
      Use this button to raise or lower the screen.x</p>
    <p>
      <b>Focus Up/Down</b></p>
    <p>
      Use this spin button to change defocus.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Focus step -/+</b></p>
    <p>
      Use these buttons to change the step size for focus changes, which is shown in 
      microns; available steps range from 0.01 to 100.</p>
