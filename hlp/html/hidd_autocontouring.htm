        Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog runs an autocontouring routine to make contours around grid squares 
      at a particular threshold level.&nbsp; The contours are then sorted into groups 
      by either their sizes or the mean intensity of the areas within them, and the 
      groups are displayed in different colors on the image.&nbsp; Various criteria 
      can be set for eliminating some of the contours, and groups of contours can also 
      be toggled off.&nbsp; The contours that are still visible can be converted to 
      Navigator polygons, with each group being a separate group of polygons.</p>
    <p>A low-magnification map generally needs to be reduced in size for this 
      operation, for two reasons: computational time is proportional to the number of 
      image pixels (the square of the size) and will become prohibitive with large 
      images; and, unreduced images can give more jagged contours.&nbsp; Computation 
      time is reasonable with images in the range of 1500-2000 pixels, and grid square 
      edges seem adequately defined when contouring is done in an image reduced so 
      that the pixel size is ~2 microns.&nbsp; If you find that the contours do not 
      follow the deatails of the square edges adequately, the remedy is to reduce 
      less, to a bigger size and a smaller pixel size.</p>
    <p>The program finds the threshold automatically by analyzing a histogram of image 
      intensities, looking for two peaks representing the intensities of the grid bars 
      and the unoccluded grid squares.&nbsp; A threshold is then set at a specified 
      fraction of the way from the lower to the upper peak.&nbsp; This relative 
      threshold generally needs to be higher than 0.5 to keep the contours inside the 
      grid bars.&nbsp; The histogram analysis can fail, in which case the main 
      recourse is to set an absolute intensity value as the threshold instead 
      (although if the image is noisy even after reduction, it is possible that more 
      reduction would make the analysis succeed).</p>
    <p>Autocontouring uses IMOD model library routines that require byte input, so the 
      reduced image is converted to bytes using the Black and White limits in the 
      Image Display control panel.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Controls of Autocontouring </em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Reduce image to</strong></p>
    <p>Choose the first radio button to specify the reduction as a number of <strong>
      pixels</strong> (of linear size, not area; specifically, the geometric mean of 
      the reduced image dimensions in X and Y).&nbsp; Shoose the second button to 
      specify the <strong>pixel size </strong>in microns to which the image should be 
      reduced.</p>
    <p><strong>Contour threshold</strong></p>
    <p>Choose <strong>Relative</strong> to set a relative threshold between the two 
      peaks of the intensity distribution.&nbsp; Choose <strong>Absolute</strong> to 
      set a specific intensity level for the threshold.</p>
    <p><strong>Range of sizes in microns</strong></p>
    <p>Enter the lower and upper limits for the square size, which will govern which 
      contours are retained bythe autocontouring operation.&nbsp; These linear sizes 
      in microns are converted to pixels in the reduced image and squared to provide 
      the limits on the number of pixels in a contoured area.</p>
    <p><strong>Autocontour Image</strong></p>
    <p>Press this button to run the autocontouring.&nbsp; It is multithreaded and can 
      take several to many seconds, depending on the image size, number of contours, 
      and how powerful the computer is.&nbsp; The processing can be stopped&nbsp; with 
      the STOP button.</p>
    <p><strong>Clear Data</strong></p>
    <p>Press this button to remove all stored data about contours that were generated.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Controls for Working with the Contours</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Split into groups</strong></p>
    <p>Select the number of groups to divide the contours into, and choose <strong>
      Size</strong> to have them order by size, or <strong>Mean value</strong> to have 
      them ordered by mean intensity within the contour.&nbsp; The ordered contours 
      will be divided into equally spaced, not equally sized, groups.&nbsp; Up to 8 
      groups can be selected.&nbsp; The colors used will be red, orange, yellow, 
      green, dark blue, cyan, violet, and magenta.&nbsp; If you are displaying fewer 
      than 8 groups and find the colors on the blue end easier to distinguish, you can 
      use the <A HREF="menu_navigator.htm#hid_montaginggrids_reversecontourcolors">Reverse Contour
            Colors</A> menu entry to reverse the order of colors, 
      starting from the magenta end.</p>
    <p><strong>Show groups</strong></p>
    <p>The checkboxes allow you to toggle the display of each group on or off and 
      control which groups are converted to Navigator polygons.</p>
    <p><strong>Lower mean cutoff</strong></p>
    <p>Use this slider or the edit box to set a lower limit on the mean intensity 
      within the grid squares to be displayed.</p>
    <p><strong>Upper mean cutoff</strong></p>
    <p>Use this slider or the edit box to set an upper limit on the mean intensity 
      within the grid squares to be displayed.</p>
    <p><strong>Minimum size cutoff</strong></p>
    <p>Use this slider or the edit box to set a lower limit on the size of the grid 
      squares to be displayed; the size here is just the square root of the area 
      within the contour.</p>
    <p><strong>Irregularity cutoff</strong></p>
    <p>Use this slider to set an upper limit on a measure of how much the contour 
      deviates from a square.&nbsp; The average angle of the lines between grid 
      squares is determined, and each contour is compared with a square at that 
      orientation and with the same area as a contour.&nbsp; The area within the 
      contour but outside the square, plus the area within the square but outside the 
      contour, is divided by the contour area.&nbsp; The measure thus ranges from 0 
      for a square to just under 1 for a long, thin contour.</p>
    <p><strong>SD cutoff</strong></p>
    <p>Use this slider to set an upper limit on the standard deviation of intensities 
      within the grid squares.&nbsp; The SD is measured on the reduced image used for 
      contouring, which is heavily smoothed by a Gaussian kernel filter with a sigma 
      of 2.5 pixels.&nbsp; The SD should thus be dominated by the presence of larger 
      structures within the grid squares, rather than by noise.</p>
    <p><strong>Edge distance cutoff</strong></p>
    <p>Use this slider or the edit box to set a lower limit on the distance of 
      contours from the edge of the area where there are contours.&nbsp; Specifically, 
      the value is the distance from the center of each contours to the convex 
      boundary of the centers of all the contours; thus, the outermost contours are at 
      a distance of 0.</p>
    <p><strong>Make Navigator Polygons</strong></p>
    <p>Press this button to convert the currently displayed contours to Navigator 
      polygons.&nbsp; <em>What you see is what you get.</em>&nbsp; Only the groups 
      whose checkbox is on will be converted, each group to a separate Navigator 
      group.&nbsp; Only the contours not eliminated by the various cutoffs will be 
      converted.&nbsp; The polygons will be given the same colors as the contours they 
      came from, or they will all be green if you have turned off
       <A HREF="#hid_montaginggrids_keepcolorsforpolygons">Keep Colors for 
            Polygons</A> in the Navigator - Montaging and Grids menu.&nbsp; After you 
      convert a subset of contours, the remaining contours should still have the same 
      group assignments.&nbsp; However, all contours will be reassigned if you change 
      any of the selection criteria, so there may then be contours in the groups you 
      just converted.</p>
    <p><strong>Undo</strong></p>
    <p>Use this button to revert the last conversion to polygons.&nbsp; This 
      operation is available only if no additions or deletions from the Navigator 
      table have been done, and new contours have not been made.&nbsp; Each conversion 
      is kept track of separately, so multiple conversions can be undone, in reverse 
      order.</p>
