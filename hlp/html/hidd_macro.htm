    <P>These windows allow one to edit scripts. For a list of available commands see <A HREF="macro_commands.htm">
        Script Commands</A> ; for general information about scripts see <A HREF="about_macros.htm">
        About scripts</A> . Several basic editing functions are available in the 
      window. Text can be selected with the mouse. Text can be cut with Ctrl X, 
      copied with Ctrl C, and pasted with Ctrl V. Ctrl Z will undo the last action. 
      While you are editing a script, the text in the window will not match the 
      version of the script stored in the program. However, running the script, closing 
      the editing window with the OK button, switching the editing window to another 
      script, or even exiting the program will transfer the text in the window to the 
      program's memory.</P>
    <P>The buttons above the text area can be used to switch the Editor window to the 
      next or previous available script, or to shift the current script down or up in 
      the list of scripts.&nbsp; Specifically:</P>
    <P><b>Left and Right Editor buttons</b> - Switch the editor window to the previous 
      or next script that is not already open in an editor.</P>
    <P><b>Up and Down Script buttons</b> - Shift a script in the list of 
      scripts; i.e., swap it with the previous or next numbered script.&nbsp; &#39;Up&#39; and 
      &#39;down&#39; here refer to the vertical position of scripts in the menu and toolbar.&nbsp; The window will 
      stay with the current script and change its number.&nbsp; If the adjacent script 
      is also open in a editor, both windows will change.</P>
    <P><b>Completions</b> - Below these buttons is a line of text that starts out with a reminder that you 
      can use Tab or ` (the back-tick character) to automatically complete a command 
      name (the first word on a line) as well as convert it to a standard mixed-case 
      form.&nbsp; Tab may not work on non-US keyboards, but ` always will.&nbsp; When 
      you start editing in a window, this line will list up to 10 possible completions 
      of the current text as you type a command.&nbsp; Only a few will show up at the 
      default window size; make the window wider to see more completions.&nbsp; </P>
    <P>The buttons below the text area perform the following functions:</P>
    <P><B>Run button - </B>will save the script in program memory and run it.</P>
    <P><B>Cancel button - </B>will close the window without saving the most recent 
      changes in program memory.</P>
    <P><B>OK button - </B>will save the script in program memory and close the window.</P>
    <P><b>Find button -</b> will search for text in the script.&nbsp; An entry box will 
      open for the text to find.&nbsp; The search is case-insensitive.</P>
    <P><B>Load button </B>- will allow you to read a script from a file into the current 
      script. Once a script has been read from a file, the Save button will save it 
      back to that file.</P>
    <P><B>Save button </B>- will allow you to save this script to a text file. If you 
      have saved it to a file before, or if you loaded it from a file, it will be 
      saved to the same file. Otherwise you will enter the <A HREF="afx_hidd_filesave.htm">
        Save As dialog box</A> to specify a file</P>
    <P><B>Save As button</B>- will allow you to save this script to a different file via 
      the <A HREF="afx_hidd_filesave.htm">Save As dialog box</A>.</P>
