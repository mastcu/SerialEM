      <P>This dialog box allows you to set the parameters for a montage, see the total 
        area to be acquired, and view the parameters after montaging has been 
        initiated. When this dialog is invoked by the Navigator to set up a montage 
        that fits a defined area, it operates in a special mode, referred to as 
        area-fitting mode. In this mode, you can adjust the number of frames and 
        overlap between frames by changing the magnification or a percentage overlap 
        factor. When one of these settings (or the binning or the selection of stage 
        versus image shift) is changed, the dialog will maintain the fit to the 
        selected area by having the Navigator recompute the number and size of frames 
        and their overlap.&nbsp; Montages will be taken with the Record camera 
        parameters by default, but this dialog includes an option to take a montage with 
        the separate Mont-map parameters.</P>
    <P>Montages can also be taken in Low Dose mode, with either the Record, View 
      or Search area imaging parameters.&nbsp; Whether a montage file can be acquired into in 
      Low Dose depends solely on whether Low Dose was on when the montage was first 
      set up.&nbsp; Thus, you need to turn on Low Dose mode before setting up a 
      montage to be taken in Low Dose.&nbsp; Several parameters cannot be changed when 
      in Low Dose mode.</P>
      <P><B>Camera radio buttons</B></P>
      <P>If you have multiple cameras, each available camera will be listed here so that 
        you can specify or see what camera will be used for montaging. The current 
        camera will be the one initially selected. If you select a different camera, it 
        will become the current camera when a montage is started.&nbsp; The camera 
        selection is fixed in Low Dose mode.</P>
      <P><B>Magnification</B></P>
      <P>When not in Low Dose mode, this setting is initially based on the current microscope magnification, but you 
        can change the magnification if desired using the spin buttons. SerialEM will 
        automatically switch to this magnification whenever acquiring a montage. You 
        can also change the magnification after montaging has been started, but you 
        will have to confirm this change the first time you do so. In area-fitting 
        mode, changing magnification will change the number of frames and may change 
        their size and overlap.&nbsp; In Low Dose mode, the magnification is simply that 
        of the Record or View area and cannot be changed here.</P>
      <P><B>Binning</B></P>
      <P>This setting is initially based on the current value in the Record parameter 
        set (or possibly the View set in Low Dose mode), but you can change the binning 
        when setting up the montage. If you do so, the program will adjust the exposure 
        time by the square of the change in binning, but you will also be warned to adjust the exposure and 
        drift settling parameters yourself. If you have already started montaging, you 
        may be able to change the binning if it is compatible with the size of the 
        pieces. In area-fitting mode, changing the binning will cause the fit to be 
        recomputed.</P>
      <P><B>Pixel size</B></P>
      <P>This value is based upon the magnification, the binning, and the calibrations in 
        SerialEM.</P>
      <P><B>Number of pieces in X and Y</B></P>
      <P>You can set the number of frames of the montage in the X and Y directions by 
        entering numbers in the text boxes or using the spin buttons. In area-fitting 
        mode, changes here will be superseded if you change any of the settings that 
        cause the fit to be recomputed.</P>
      <P><B>Piece size in X and Y</B></P>
      <P>You can set the size of each piece in X and Y by entering values in these text 
        boxes. The default is the full size of the CCD camera. In area-fitting mode, 
        changes here will be superseded if you change any of the settings that cause 
        the fit to be recomputed.</P>
      <P><B>Overlap in X and Y</B></P>
      <P>You can set the amount of overlap between pieces by entering values in these 
        text boxes. The default is 10% of the frame size of the CCD camera when doing a 
        montage with image shift. When using stage movements, the overlaps are 
        constrained by a minimum percentage and by a minimum absolute distance in 
        microns. You can use the <B>Reset</B> button to restore the values to the 10% 
        default for image shift or the minimum required for stage montages. These 
        values may change when new piece sizes are entered.</P>
      <P>In area-fitting mode, these fields are disabled and overlap is adjusted with the 
        minimum overlap controls instead.</P>
      <P><B>Minimum overlap factor (Montage with stage movement only)</B></P>
      <P>These controls allow you to adjust the minimum amount of overlap required when 
        doing a stage montage. At lower magnifications, a percentage is enough to 
        guarantee enough overlap, but an absolute minimum amount of overlap is needed 
        to get enough overlap at higher magnifications, because of the imprecision of 
        stage movement. Use the spin buttons to adjust the minimum overlap between 
        pieces as a percentage of the largest piece dimension, and enter a value in the 
        text box to change the minimum overlap in microns. Overlaps will be increased 
        to meet an increased minimum, but will not be decreased when you decrease a 
        minimum until you press the <B>Reset</B> button.</P>
      <P>In area-fitting mode, the overlap will change automatically not matter which 
        direction the minimum is changed, and the number of frames may change to 
        maintain the fit to the desired area.</P>
      <P><B>Total area and Update</B></P>
      <P>The total area is computed based on the pixel size, number of pieces, piece size 
        and overlaps. It is recomputed whenever you push a button or leave a text box, 
        but to be sure the value is current, just push the <B>Update</B> button.</P>
      <P><B>Move stage instead of shifting Image</B></P>
      <P>Select this option to have the montage acquired by moving the stage instead of 
        using electronic image shift. Image shift is quite accurate but has a limited 
        range at medium and high magnifications (generally less than ~15 microns, but less 
        than ~3 microns on some microscopes such as 300 KV Tecnai/Polara). Stage shift 
        can be used when these limits need to be exceeded. Note that in LM mode, image 
        shift has a much higher range, so you may be able to use image shift instead of 
        stage shift at the highest LM mode magnifications. In area-fitting mode, the 
        fit will be recomputed and it may not be possible to change this setting.</P>
      <P><B>Skip pieces outside Navigator item</B></P>
      <P>With this option, it is possible to define a polygon in the Navigator and have 
        each montage that is taken include only pieces that have some portion inside 
        the polygon. This option is not needed when taking a montage that was fit to a 
        polygon but would be useful when taking multiple montages in a region (e.g., 
        supermontaging). After checking the option, enter the position of the desired 
        polygon item in the Navigator table (numbered from 1), or enter 0 to use the 
        current Navigator item or the polygon that was used to define the supermontage 
        including the current item. In other words, the option is only needed when 
        supermontaging, and the value just needs to be 0. The legality of the item 
        number will not be checked until the montage is started. If the Navigator is 
        not open at that time, this setting is ignored.</P>
      <P><B>Do full rectangle; ignore list of pieces to skip</B></P>
      <P>When a montage is set up by the Navigator, it will compose a list of pieces that 
        do not need to be acquired because they fall outside the polygon used to define 
        the montage area. The option allows one to acquire the complete array of 
        pieces, including ones on the list to skip.</P>
      <P><B>Ask about making map after each montage</B></P>
      <P>If this option is checked, then when you take a montage manually, the program 
        will ask whether you want to make a Navigator map. It is available only when 
        the Navigator is open. It is turned on when you set up a montage through the 
        Navigator; otherwise it is off by default. If you answer with 'Cancel' by 
        mistake when asked if you want to make a map, you can use this option to 
        re-enable the offers to make a map.</P>
    <P><b>Use Montage mapping, not Record parameters</b></P>
    <P>If this option is checked and enabled, montages will be taken with the Mont-map 
      camera parameter set instead of Record parameters.&nbsp; The option is most 
      likely to be useful for taking maps, which often involve different exposure time 
      and binning from montages for data acquisition; but it could also be useful if 
      you routinely take montages for other uses with different parameters from the 
      Record ones.&nbsp; The option is disabled if one of the two options described 
      next is 
      selected in Low Dose mode, or if the Mont-map parameters are being hidden with 
      the <a href="#hid_camera_userecordformontage">No Mont. Map Params</a> option in 
      the Camera menu.</P>
    <P><b>Use View parameters in Low Dose mode</b></P>
    <P>If this option is checked, montages in Low Dose mode will be taken with the 
      View camera and imaging parameters instead of Record parameters.&nbsp; This is 
      useful for mapping in Low Dose because a View shift offset can be set to align 
      the View and Record areas (see 
      <a href="hidd_lowdose.htm#viewShiftOffset">Shift offset for View or Search</a>).&nbsp; 
      When this option is turned on, the program may turn the option for moving the 
      stage on or off depending on the field of view of View images.&nbsp; When using 
      View parameters is turned off again, it will restore the 
      previous setting of the stage move option if that is known.</P>
    <P><b>Use Search parameters in Low Dose mode</b></P>
    <P>If this option is checked, montages in Low Dose mode will be taken with the 
      Search imaging parameters instead of Record or View parameters.&nbsp; The Search 
      camera parameters will be used, unless the <a href="#hid_camera_useviewforsearch">Use View for Search</a> 
      option is selected in the Camera menu.&nbsp; Search mode may be useful for 
      low-magnification mapping in Low Dose because a Search shift offset can be set to align 
      the Search area with higher magnification areas.&nbsp; When this option is 
      turned on, the program may turn the option for moving the stage on or off 
      depending on the field of view of Search images.&nbsp; When using Search 
      parameters is turned 
      off again, it will restore the previous setting of the stage move option if that 
      is known.</P>
    <P><b>Use continuous mode with settling factor</b></P>
    <P>This option is enabled for Gatan cameras where continuous camera acquisition 
      can be used through the SerialEMCCD plugin and allows a montage to be acquired 
      by selecting from the stream of images taken in continuous mode.&nbsp; It is 
      most effective for OneView and Rio cameras, where drift correction can be used in 
      continuous mode to produce good-quality images even if there is some residual 
      drift in the images.&nbsp; It could also be useful for taking good-quality 
      montages with a K2/K3 or Orius camera if the normal settling time after movement is 
      used, or for taking maps with a reduced settling time.&nbsp; The settling factor 
      is a multiplier applied to the normal settling time that is allowed to elapse 
      after an image or stage shift before starting a regular image acquisition.&nbsp; 
      In continuous mode, the program will allow the modified settling time to elapse 
      before asking for the next image that comes from the camera.&nbsp; You will need 
      to experiment with this factor to determine what value gives adequate quality 
      for your application.&nbsp; Small values like 0.25 to 0.5, or even 0, may be 
      acceptable with a OneView doing drift correction.</P>
    <P><b>Turn off Drift Correction for stage montage</b></P>
    <P>This option is enabled when a montage with stage movement is to be taken with a 
      OneView camera.&nbsp; If it is turned on, the Drift Correction setting can be 
      left on in the Record parameters but the correction will not be used when taking 
      images for the montage.&nbsp; The reason this may be desirable is that the 
      OneView discards frames that it fails to align, giving images with counts that 
      are lower proportional to the number of lost frames.&nbsp; This can easily 
      happen when taking maps of areas that contain some empty regions.&nbsp; The 
      program keeps track of two settings of this option, one for regular and one for 
      &quot;high-quality&quot; stage montages (described in the next section).&nbsp; The initial 
      defaults are to have the option off for high-quality montages and on for regular 
      ones.</P>
      <P><B>Use settings for high-quality stage montage</B></P>
      <P>Use this option to activate a collection of settings that are relevant only when 
        doing large stage montages for acquisition of data to be analyzed, as opposed 
        to maps. These options appear when the box is checked:</P>
      <P><B>Autofocus at each piece</B></P>
      <P>Select this option to have the autofocus routine run before acquiring each 
        piece. This will have no effect in Low Mag mode. Turn this on will turn off 
        'Autofocus in blocks', and vice versa.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Repeat until drift is below a limit</STRONG></P>
      <P style="Z-INDEX: 0">Select this option to have autofocus repeated if the drift, 
        in nanometers per second, is above the limit that you enter in the text 
        box.&nbsp; The option is available only when autofocusing at each piece.&nbsp; 
        The program will repeat the autofocus up to five times if necessary, then go on 
        to acquire the piece.&nbsp; You must have the <A href="#hid_focus_driftprotection">Drift 
          Protection</A>&nbsp;option in the focus menu selected for 
        this&nbsp;operation to work.</P>
      <P><B>Autofocus in blocks of pieces</B></P>
      <P>Select this option to acquire the montage in square blocks of a size selectable 
        with the spin button, and to have the autofocus routine run at the center of 
        each block before starting the block. This option radically changes the order 
        of piece acquisition. Without blocks, pieces are acquired in columns (along the 
        Y axis of the camera). With blocks, a whole block is acquired (in columns just 
        like a montage of that size), then the next block is acquired in Y, etc. After 
        finishing a column of blocks, the program shifts over by the block size in X to 
        start the next column.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Realign with image shift up to a limit</STRONG></P>
      <P style="Z-INDEX: 0">This option can be used to deal with several problems with 
        stage montages: irregular movements that produce variable amounts of overlap; 
        long-term drift that results in overlaps between very long columns being 
        inadequate because a long interval passes between successive passes up the 
        column;&nbsp;and even some inaccuracy in the stage calibration.&nbsp; For every 
        piece after the first one, the program picks an adjacent, 
        already-acquired&nbsp;piece to align to, moves the stage to the target location 
        of the piece to be acquired&nbsp;(based on the actual position at which the 
        neighbor was acquired), autofocuses if that option is selected, then sets image 
        shift in order to take an image that overlaps as much as possible with the one 
        from the adjacent piece.&nbsp; The amount to shift is limited by the number in 
        the text box, in microns.&nbsp; The image is aligned and image shift is then 
        set to take a picture that is in exactly the right location relative to the 
        neighbor. However, if the alignment shift is larger than the percentage 
        indicated in the text box for <STRONG>Maximum alignment shift as % of piece</STRONG>, 
        then it will be ignored.</P>
      <P style="Z-INDEX: 0">
        This option cannot be used together with focusing in blocks.&nbsp; Using image 
        shift can be slow because of the settling time required after an image 
        shift.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are doing&nbsp;extensive acquisition with this option, 
        you should see if you can reduce this delay time using the procedure described 
        for&nbsp;<A href="menu_calibration.htm#hid_calibration_set_is_delay_factor">Set IS 
          Delay Factor</A> in the Calibrate menu.</P>
    <P style="Z-INDEX: 0">
        With this option selected, the program will remind you to calibrate image shift 
        for the current magnification, but only if the possible error in overlap caused 
        by plausible errors in the current shift calibration is large enough.&nbsp; 
        Large amounts of image shift as a fraction of the frame size, and narrow overlap 
        zones, will trigger this reminder.</P>
      <P style="Z-INDEX: 0"><STRONG>Go from center out; anchor at lower mag</STRONG></P>
      <P>When using realignment with image shift, this option can be used to protect 
        against the possibility of poor correlation alignments at the periphery of the 
        area being acquired (e.g., due to grid bars or empty resin).&nbsp; Pieces will 
        be acquired from the center outward: for each column, the program starts in the 
        middle of the column and goes down then up; columns are done from the center 
        leftward, then from the center rightward.&nbsp; In order to find the center 
        again for the second half, an 'anchor' image will be taken at the 
        magnification&nbsp;selected with&nbsp;the spinner and stored in a temporary 
        file before the montage is started.&nbsp; The program will also use this image 
        to estimate the backlash occurring between the two directions of 
        movement.&nbsp; For reliable correlations, the image needs to have a field of 
        view at least twice as big as the possible drift in stage position over the 
        first half of the acquisition.&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, the program will&nbsp;try 
        to pick a&nbsp;magnification that gives a field of view of at least 20 microns 
        as long as that is not in low mag; thereafter it will remember your 
        setting.&nbsp; Be sure that images can be taken at the chosen magnification 
        without the aperture occupying more than the corners of the image.</P>
      <P><B>Delay time after moving stage</B></P>
      <P>The value here sets the delay time between stage movement and the acquisition 
        of an image. This delay may need to be longer than the default to give images without 
        drift.&nbsp; Currently, the default of 2 seconds (or whatever is set in the 
        properties file with &#39;StageMoveDelay&#39;) will be applied as a minimum delay and a 
        value here of less than the default is ignored.</P>
      <P><B>Skip correlations used to align pieces</B></P>
      <P>The correlations that are usually used to assess how well pieces align can 
        consume a significant fraction of the acquisition time, especially when the 
        option is checked in the Montage Control Panel to treat the montage as 'Very 
        sloppy'. Use this option to disable the correlations. Note that correlations 
        will not be done for montages with more than 200 pieces, regardless of this 
        setting.</P>
