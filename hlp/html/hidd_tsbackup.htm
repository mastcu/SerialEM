    <P>This dialog box allows you to back up in the tilt series, assess the alignment 
      or quality of images at previous tilts, and resume at a selected tilt angle. 
      When you do that, new images will be taken at each tilt and used to overwrite 
      the existing images until you reach the place that you backed up from. The 
      dialog box presents a selection of tilts, listed by their Z values in the file 
      and by their tilt angles. Select one and push the GO button to back up to that 
      tilt.
    </P>
    <P>When you select an angle, the program will tilt back to that angle, compensating 
      for backlash, read in the stored image for that tilt angle and place it in 
      buffer A, and read in the stored image for the previous tilt angle and place it 
      in buffer D (the autoalign buffer). If you resume from that point, the program 
      will start with tracking and focusing at the new tilt angle, aligning images to 
      the reference from the previous angle. If you are montaging, the program will 
      recompose the center image for the selected angle and for the previous tilt.</P>
    <P>If you tilt back too far, you can open this dialog box again and tilt forward 
      again. You can only tilt forward to the last angle that was finished, not 
      necessarily to the angle at which you stopped.</P>
    <P>If you are in low dose mode, the program maintains a stash of tracking reference 
      images which it can access to set up buffers appropriately when backing up. 
      Specifically, it will place the stored image from the previous tilt in D and 
      one of the tracking reference images in E. You can then autoalign either Trial 
      or Record images at the new tilt angle. Your choice of angles to back up to may 
      be constrained because of the limited number of tracking references available. 
        When doing dose-symmetric tilt series, there are four reference buffers: D and E 
        for the references when tilting in the negative direction, and F and G for the 
        Record and tracking references when tilting the positive direction.&nbsp; The 
        program will restore references all of these buffers when backing up.&nbsp; 
        Autoalign will align a new image to the appropriate buffer, and the <strong>
        Align To</strong> button will be labeled accordingly.</P>
    <P>If you are working at a high magnification and need low mag tracking, you may 
      have to get the specimen aligned manually after backing up, since there is not 
      guaranteed to be an appropriate low mag reference in the second autoalign 
      buffer.</P>
