        Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog allows you to use the Holefinder module to find circular holes in a 
      support film that are arranged in a square lattice.&nbsp; This module was developed in the IMOD program 
      Imodfindholes.&nbsp; It finds holes by a sequence of steps, starting with an 
      image reduction to bring the holes to a diameter of ~50 pixels, then a smoothing 
      filter, and edge detection with a Sobel filter and a Canny edge detector.&nbsp; 
      This edge image is correlated with a series of circular templates to determine 
      the best size, preliminary positions are found, the edge image is averaged over 
      the positions with the strongest correlations, and this average edge template is 
      correlated with the edge image.&nbsp; Positions are then analyzed for whether they
      are at regular spacings and angles with respect to each other.&nbsp; The actual 
      reduced image is then averaged at most of the found positions and the resulting 
      image template is correlated with the reduced image.&nbsp; The positions from 
      this correlation are separately analyzed for location on a regular grid, and 
      results from the two methods are merged.&nbsp; Holes with extreme outlying 
      intensities are eliminated.</p>
    <p>There are two parameters that determine the efficacy of the edge detection: the 
      initial filter and the threshold for the Canny edge detector.&nbsp; Optimal 
      results are obtained by doing the entire analysis with a series of values and 
      using the filter/threshold pair that detects the most holes.</p>
    <p>For a montage, this analysis is done on the overview image as currently 
      displayed, although the program may reload the overview with less binning if 
      holes are too small in the current image.&nbsp; Individual montage pieces are 
      then analyzed with both average edge and image templates to find hole positions 
      on each piece.&nbsp; These positions are used to refine and add to those from 
      the overview image, so that each point ends up with an accurately measured 
      position on a specific montage piece that can be used with the Realign to Item 
      routine.&nbsp; This method can overcome the deficiencies in the alignment of 
      pieces in the overview image, provided that the error in alignment of adjacent 
      pieces is less than half&nbsp; the periodicity of the holes.&nbsp; If the error is 
      larger than this, the program will not be able to resolve positions between the 
      pieces accurately, and some holes will be missed or duplicated.</p>
    <p>When an overview has bad piece alignments (half a hole periodicity or more), you 
      need to get an overview with less error, not a perfect alignment. The recourse 
      is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Turn off &#39;Treat as very sloppy montage&#39; in the Montage Control panel, if it is 
        on.&nbsp; This will usually prevent alignment errors from giving large shifts 
        between pieces.</li>
      <li>If alignments are still bad, turn off &#39;Align pieces in overview&#39;.</li>
      <li>If errors are still too large, you need a better stage calibration or 
        high-defocus magnification calibrations.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The hole-finding operation is done on the current active image in the main 
      buffer display.&nbsp; Before starting, the program analyzes the autocorrelation 
      of the image to get an independent check on the entered value for periodicity 
      and puts up a message box with 3 choices: to stop and measure the hole-to-hole 
      spacing directly, to go with the entered values, or to go on and skip this 
      analysis in the future.&nbsp; The autocorrelation analysis is not infallible so 
      you may need to go on.</p>
    <p>
      After finding holes, the image data in the holes is 
      analyzed in 3 ways: the mean intensity is computed; pixels are smoothed by 
      averaging 3x3 blocks of pixels and the standard deviation (SD) of smoothed 
      values is computed; and the percentage of pixels that would be considered dark 
      outliers will be estimated.&nbsp; In this dialog, you can set a lower and upper 
      cutoff for the mean intensity and upper cutoffs for the SD and percent of black 
      pixels.&nbsp; These cutoffs are initially constrained to the extreme values of 
      the first set of holes analyzed, but then become independent settings retained 
      between sets of holes.&nbsp; A cutoff can thus be outside the range found in the 
      current set of holes, which is useful if none of the holes in this particular 
      gris square approach the extremes that are being eliminated.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hole size</strong></p>
    <p>
      Enter the size of the holes in microns.&nbsp; This needs to be accurate to 
      within ~10%, preferably better.&nbsp; After you successfully find holes with 
      your initial value and get an estimate of the actual hole size, use the <strong>
      Set Size/Period</strong> button to adopt that new size for future runs.&nbsp;
      <strong>To measure hole size, zoom up so that the holes are at least half the 
      size of the control panels on the screen. </strong>&nbsp;Measurements in an 
      unzoomed image may not be accurate enough.&nbsp; Hold down the shift key and the 
      left mouse button to draw a line across a hole.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Periodicity</strong></p>
    <p>
      Enter the distance between 
      the centers of the holes in microns.&nbsp; This is not the separation between the edges 
      of adjacent holes; that value is shown in the label to the right that include the 
      conventional (size/sep) designation for grids.&nbsp; The periodicity needs to be accurate 
      within ~15%.&nbsp; <strong>To measure hole periodicity, zoom up so that the holes 
      are at least half the size of the control panels on the screen. </strong>&nbsp;Hold 
      down the shift key and use the left mouse button to draw a line from the edge of 
      one hole to the edge of the next one, being careful not to measure between 
      diagonal neighbors.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Maximum error</strong></p>
    <p>
      Enter the maximum deviation allowed between a point and the predicted location 
      of that point, based on a fit to positions in up to a 5x5 array of neighboring 
      points.&nbsp; Points will be dropped if they exceed this error.&nbsp; A value of 
      0.05 should be good.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Exclude holes outside polygon</strong></p>
    <p>
      With this option checked, the program will look for polygons most of whose 
      points fall on the current image, and take the smallest such one as a boundary 
      polygon.&nbsp; The option is ignored if no polygon is found, so it can be left 
      on if you ever use it.&nbsp; Stray points on the grid bar should be easy to 
      eliminate with the lower mean intensity cutoff, but the option to use a polygon 
      is available if points outside the grid square are numerous enough to ruin the 
      hole detection.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Filters to try</strong></p>
    <p>
      The program can apply two different initial filters: Gaussian smoothing with a 
      specified sigma value, or median filtering with a given number of iterations.&nbsp; 
      While smoothing is most often best, median filtering may be optimal for some 
      kinds of data; thus it is advisable to try both.&nbsp; Sigma values in pixels 
      are entered in the &#39;Gaussian sigma&#39; box and iteration numbers in the &#39;Median 
      filter iterations&#39; box, separated by spaces; either box may be left blank.&nbsp; Median filtering 
      can reduce noise while preserving the sharpness of the hole edge and may be 
      better in some cases.&nbsp; The default entries are sigma 1.5, 2, and 3 for 
      Gaussian smoothing and 3 iterations of the median filter.&nbsp; The median 
      filter takes longer.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Edge threshold</strong></p>
    <p>
      This threshold entry specifies the percentage of pixels in the Sobel-filtered 
      image that will be taken as &#39;strong&#39; edge points and form the seed for the final 
      edge image. The Canny edge detector also has a lower threshold for selecting 
      points as &#39;weak&#39; edge points.&nbsp; The lower threshold is taken to be twice the 
      upper one.&nbsp; Enter one or more thresholds separated by spaces.&nbsp; The 
      default entries are 2, 3.2, and 4.4.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bracket last filter/threshold values</strong></p>
    <p>
      Without this option on, the total number of filter/threshold combinations tried 
      is the product of the number of filters and the number of thresholds.&nbsp;
      After one set of holes has been analyzed, this option can be used to try only 
      the subset of the filter and threshold values adjacent to the ones that were 
      last found to be optimal.&nbsp; This can save variable amounts of time.&nbsp; 
      The fewest trials will be done if both previous values were at one end of their 
      respective range; if the values are in the middle of each range of 3 or more 
      items, 9 trials will still be done.&nbsp; Simply adopting the values found on 
      one analysis and applying them on further grid squares was not adequate when 
      tested during development.</p>
    <p><strong>Find Holes</strong></p>
    <p>Press this button to analyze the currently active image.&nbsp; The results from 
      each trial pair of filter and threshold values will be shown on a line below 
      this button: the number of points found, and the number missing from a regular 
      grid.&nbsp; When the trials are done, the final result will be shown, along with 
      the hole size and periodicity found.&nbsp;
      </p>
    <p><strong>Set Size/Period</strong></p>
    <p>Use the hole size and separation from the last hole-finding operation to set 
      the values in the size and periodicity text boxes above.&nbsp; It is useful to do 
      this once to replace the nominal values that you start with.</p>
    <p><strong>Clear Data</strong></p>
    <p>Use this button to remove the display of found points and free up all memory 
      used in Holefinder.&nbsp; Neither of these should be necessary in routine use.
      &nbsp; Holefinder caches template transforms so that they can be reused on the next
      set of holes if they are the same size, saving some time, so it is best not to clear the 
      data unless memory is limited.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Lower mean cutoff</strong></p>
    <p>Use the slider or enter a value in the text box to exclude holes whose mean 
      intensity is below the selected value.&nbsp; This slider ranges from the minimum 
      to the median intensity.&nbsp; You can enter a value outside the range of the 
      slider.</p>
    <p><strong>Upper mean cutoff</strong></p>
    <p>Use the slider or enter a value in the text box to exclude holes whose mean 
      intensity is above the selected value.&nbsp; This slider ranges from the median 
      to the maximum intensity.&nbsp; You can enter a value outside the range of the 
      slider.</p>
    <p><strong>SD cutoff</strong></p>
    <p>Use the slider to exclude holes where the standard deviation of smoothed 
      intensity exceeds the selected value.</p>
    <p><strong>Black pixel % cutoff</strong></p>
    <p>Use the slider to exclude holes where the pecentage of smoothed pixel values 
      that are negative outliers exceeds the selected value.</p>
    <p><strong>Show Included</strong></p>
    <p>Use this option to toggle whether the included points (the ones passing all the 
      cutoffs) are displayed.&nbsp; Included points are displayed in magenta.</p>
    <p><strong>Show Excluded</strong></p>
    <p>Use this option to toggle whether the points excluded by any of these cutoffs 
      are displayed.&nbsp; Points below the lower mean cutoff are displayed in light 
      blue and ones above the upper mean cutoff are in dark blue.&nbsp; Ones excluded 
      by the SD cutoff or black pixel cutoff are displayed in light or dark blue 
      depending on which mean cutoff their means are closest to.</p>
    <p><strong>Toggle Points</strong></p>
    <p>This button can be pressed to turn off the display of all points temporarily; 
      the points will be redsiaplyed when the button is released.</p>
    <p><strong>Layout of points</strong></p>
    <p>These radio buttons determine the sequence in which points will be placed in 
      the Navigator table by the following button.&nbsp; They represent the same 
      options allowed when using the
      <a href="menu_navigator.htm#hid_navigator_addgridofpoints">Add Grid of Points</a> 
      command: 1) &#39;Zigzag&#39; will go up one column 
      and down the next. 2) &#39;Away from focus&#39; will move in the same direction within 
      each column or row, the direction away from the Focus area.&nbsp; 3) &#39;In groups&#39; 
      will place the points in groups no bigger than the size set with Set Group 
      Radius, with the first point near the center of the group and other points 
      accessed by folowing a zigzag path.
      This selection is independent of whether the menu option
      <a href="menu_navigator.htm#hid_montaginggrids_grouppointsingrid">Divide Points into Groups</a> option 
      is on.</p>
    <p><strong>Make Navigator Points</strong></p>
    <p>Press this button to generate a set of Navigator points from the included 
      holes, ordered in the chosen way.&nbsp; Points will be marked for acquisition.&nbsp; 
      When points are placed into multiple groups, a message box will appear showing 
      the number of groups and their average size and giving you the chance to reject 
      the division.&nbsp; Otherwise, points will be placed into a single group.</p>
    <p>The hole positions will no longer be displayed after points are put into the 
      Navigator table, provided that the first (or only) created group still has some 
      points in it.&nbsp; To bring back the display of the hole positions, delete that 
      group of points in the table by using the 'Collapse groups' option in the 
      <a href="hidd_navigator.htm">Navigator Dialog</a>.</p>
