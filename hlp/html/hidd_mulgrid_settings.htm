        Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog lets you store separate settings for individual grids in five 
      different categories.&nbsp; The Final Data parameters in the
      <a href="hidd_navacquire.htm">Navigator Acquire at Items</a>&nbsp; dialog can be 
      modified and stored in their entirety.&nbsp; The dialog simply indicates whether 
      these are stored or not for the current grid.&nbsp; For autocontouring, hole 
      finding, and multiple Record acquisition, a subset of parameters are stored. &nbsp;The 
      final category consists of a few other general program settings that would 
      typically differ between gold and carbon grids.&nbsp; Each section for the lower 
      four categories has two summary lines: One labeled &#39;Current&#39; showing the 
      current settings, and one labeled &#39;<strong>Grid</strong>&#39; showing the stored 
      settings for the current grid in the <a href="hidd_multi_grid.htm">Multiple Grid 
      Operations</a> dialog, if any, or simply saying that there are none.&nbsp; The 
      selected grid can be changed in that dialog and this dialog will respond 
      appropriately.</p>
    <p>Unlike in the Navigator dialog, there is no inheritance of modified parameters 
      from one item to the next; separate settings must be stored for each grid 
      needing them.</p>
    <p><strong>Final Data Acquire Settings</strong></p>
    <p>To set these parameters for one grid, simply press <strong>Set/View for Grid
      </strong>to open 
      the <a href="hidd_navacquire.htm">Navigator Acquire at Items</a> dialog, adjust 
      the parameter settings there, and press the 'Close' button.&nbsp; The settings 
      will be stored without affecting the global settings to be used for the other 
      grids.&nbsp; The same button is used if you want to check or modify previously 
      stored parameters.&nbsp; The <strong>Revert to Global</strong> button can be 
      used to discard the stored settings and retrun to using the globally set one.</p>
    <p>To apply the same settings to other grids without having to make the individual 
      changes over and over, press <strong>Apply Grid as Current</strong>.&nbsp; Then 
      select each other grid in turn, pressing <strong>Set/View for Grid</strong> and 
      just closing the <a href="hidd_navacquire.htm">Navigator Acquire at Items</a> dialog, 
      which has the modified settings already.&nbsp; When done, press <strong>Restore 
      Current</strong> to restore the global parameters.</p>
    <p><strong>Other Parameter Categories</strong></p>
    <p>Setting parameters for the other categories is bit more cumbersome because this 
      dialog does not have control over the other dialogs involved in those settings.&nbsp; 
      Here, the procedure to set parameters for a grid when none are stored yet is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Press <strong>Save Current Settings</strong> so that you can modify settings 
        and then easily return to the global ones.</li>
      <li>Change settings in the appropriate dialog, menu item, or control panel.&nbsp; 
        Menu accelerator keys are Alt-N-M-U to open the <a href="hidd_autocontour.htm">
        Autocontouring Grid Squares</a> dialog, Alt-N-M-N for the
        <a href="hidd_hole_finder.htm">Hole Finder</a> dialog, and Alt-N-M-M for the
        <a href="hidd_multi_shot_setup.htm">Multiple Record Setup</a> dialog.&nbsp; When 
        you make changes in those dialogs, they do not need be closed afterwards.</li>
      <li>Press <strong>Use Current for Grid</strong> to save the settings for that 
        grid.</li>
      <li>To apply the same settings to other grids, select each other grid in turn in 
        the <a href="hidd_multi_grid.htm">Multiple Grid 
      Operations</a> dialog and press <strong>Use Current for Grid.</strong></li>
      <li>Press <strong>Restore Current</strong> to put the saved settings back in 
        place.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      When a grid has settings, the third button is labeled Apply Grid as Current.&nbsp; 
      Pressing it both saves the current settings and imposes the stored ones, which 
      can be modified.&nbsp; Thus, to modify stored settings, you go through the same 
      sequence of steps as just described.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>General Settings</strong></p>
    <p>This category currently captures three settings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Whether to disable trimming of dark borders when doing various alignments, a 
        set of three values set with the <a href="menu_tasks.htm#hid_special_disable_dark_trim_in_align">
            Disable Dark Trim in Align</a></li> item in the Tasks - Specialized Options menu.
      <li>Whether to erase periodic correlation peaks in general alignments and 
        focusing, set with a checkbox in the <a href="hidd_alignfocus.htm">Image 
        Alignment &amp; Focus</a> panel.<li>Whether to erase periodic correlation peaks 
        in Realign to Item, set with the <a href="menu_navigator#hid_navigator_eraseperiodiccorr">Erase Periodic Peaks 
            in LD</a> item in the Navigator menu.</ul>
