        Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog lets you store separate settings for individual grids in five 
      different categories.&nbsp; The first category consists of a few general program 
      settings that would typically differ between gold and carbon grids.&nbsp; The 
      next three categories are for autocontouring, hole finding, and multiple Record 
      acquisition; in each of these, a subset of parameters are stored. &nbsp;Each section 
      for the top 
      four categories has two summary lines.&nbsp; One is labeled either &#39;Global&#39;, showing the 
      current settings, or &#39;Saved global&#39;, showing the global settings before they 
      were modified for individual grids.&nbsp; The other summary is labeled &#39;<strong>Grid</strong>&#39; and shows the stored 
      settings for the current grid in the <a href="hidd_multi_grid.htm">Multiple Grid 
      Operations</a> dialog, if any, or simply saying that there are none. The last 
      section is for the Final Data parameters in the
      <a href="hidd_navacquire.htm">Navigator Acquire at Items</a>&nbsp; dialog, which 
      can be modified and stored in their entirety.&nbsp; The dialog simply indicates 
      whether these are stored or not for the current grid.&nbsp; The 
      selected grid can be changed in the <a href="hidd_multi_grid.htm">Multiple Grid 
      Operations</a> dialog and this dialog will respond 
      appropriately.</p>
    <p>Unlike iUnlike in the Navigator dialog, there is no inheritance of modified parameters 
      from one item to the next; separate settings must be stored for each grid 
      needing them.</p>
    <p><strong>Top Four Parameter Categories</strong></p>
    <p>Setting parameters for the these categories is bit odd because this 
      dialog does not have control over the other dialogs involved in those settings.&nbsp; 
      Here, the procedure to set parameters for a grid when none are stored yet is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Press <strong>Save Global for Restoring</strong> so that you can modify settings 
        and then easily return to the global ones.&nbsp; If there is a dialog for those 
        settings, it will be opened or brough to the foreground.</li>
      <li>Change settings in the appropriate dialog, menu item, or control panel.&nbsp; 
        When 
        you make changes in those dialogs, they do not need be closed afterwards.</li>
      <li>Press <strong>Set for Grid</strong> to save the settings for that 
        grid.</li>
      <li>To apply the same settings to other grids, select each other grid in turn in 
        the "hidd_multi_grid.htm">Multiple Grid 
      Operations</a> dialog  dialog and press <strong>Set for Grid.</strong></li>
      <li>Press <strong>Restore Global</strong> to put the saved settings back in 
        place.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      When a grid has settings, the 
      first button is labeled Apply Grid Settings to Global.&nbsp; 
      Pressing it both saves the current settings and imposes the stored ones, which 
      can be modified.&nbsp; Thus, to modify stored settings, you go through the same 
      sequence of steps as just described.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>General Settings></p>
    <p>This catThis category currently captures three settings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Whether to disable trimming of dark borders when doing various alignments, a 
        set of three values set with the <a href="menu_tasks.htm#hid_special_disable_dark_trim_in_align">
            Disable Dark Trim in Align</a></li> item in the Tasks - Specialized Options menu.
      <li>Whether to erase periodic correlation peaks in general alignments and 
        focusing, set with a checkbox in the <a href="hidd_alignfocus.htm">Image 
        Alignment &amp; Focus</a> panel.<li>Whether to erase periodic correlation peaks 
        in Realign to Item, set with the <a href="menu_navigator#hid_navigator_eraseperiodiccorr">Erase Periodic Peaks 
            in LD</a> item in the Navigator menu.</ul>
    <p><strong>Final Data Acquire Settings</strong></p>
    <p>To set these parameters for one grid, simply press <strong>Set/View for Grid
      </strong>to open 
      the <a href="hidd_navacquire.htm">Navigator Acquire at Items</a> dialog, adjust 
      the parameter settings there, and press the 'Close' button.&nbsp; The settings 
      will be stored without affecting the global settings to be used for the other 
      grids.&nbsp; The same button is used if you want to check or modify previously 
      stored parameters.&nbsp; The <strong>Discard Grid Settings</strong> button can be 
      used to discard the stored settings and return to using the globally set one.</p>
    <p>To apply the same settings to other grids without having to make the individual 
      changes over and over, press <strong>Apply Grid Settings to Global</strong>.&nbsp; Then 
      select each other grid in turn, pressing <strong>Set/View for Grid</strong> and 
      just closing the <a href="hidd_navacquire.htm">Navigator Acquire at Items</a> dialog, 
      which has the modified settings already.&nbsp; When done, press <strong>Restore 
      Global</strong> to restore the global parameters.</p>
