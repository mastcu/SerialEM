        multiple image windows in SerialEM:</P>

      <P><A NAME="hid_window_new"></A><B>New Window command (Window menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to copy the active image into a new window.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_window_cascade"></A><B>Cascade command (Window menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to arrange multiple image windows in an overlapped fashion.
      </P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_window_tile"></A><B>Tile command (Window menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to arrange multiple image windows in a non-overlapped fashion.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_resize_main"></A><B>Resize Main command (Window menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to restore the main window to fill all of the space inside the 
        SerialEM frame.</P>
      <P>Shortcut Key CTRL+SHIFT+R.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_window_stage_move_tool"></A><B>Stage Move Tool command (Window menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to open the <a href="hidd_stagemovetool.htm">Stage Move Tool</a>, 
      which allows you to move the stage in any direction by a fraction or multiple of 
      the camera field of view.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_window_showscopecontrolpanel"></A><B>Show Scope Control command (Window menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to toggle whether the <a href="hidd_remotecontrol.htm">Microscope Control Panel</a> 
      is included in the collection of control panels.&nbsp; If you have no use for 
      it, you can remove it completely instead of having it closed up.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_window_takescreenshot"></A><B>Take Image Snapshot command (Window menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to open the <a href="hidd_screenshot.htm">Image Snapshot</a> dialog and take
      a snapshot of the contents of an image window.
    </P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_window_multichannelstemdisplay"></A><B>Multichannel Display command (Window menu)</B></P>
      <p>Use this command to open a dialog with a set of checkboxes for controlling 
        whether different STEM channels are displayed in separate windows.&nbsp; Use the 
        first checkbox to control whether to use the multi-window display.&nbsp; The 
        checkboxes below select which detectors will be displayed in separate windows.&nbsp; 
        When this display is enabled, the windows will open on the next STEM 
        acquisition, unless there is already a side-by-side FFT window open.&nbsp; A 
        window will be opened for every channel selected in the dialog, with the name of 
        the detector in the title bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the acquisition does not acquire 
        from all of those channels, the rest of the windows will be left blank. A new 
        acquisition will roll the existing images down in the buffer stack for each 
        window, which can contain 3 images by default.&nbsp; The number of buffers can 
        be set with the MaxMultiChannelBuffers property entry.&nbsp; Buffers are labeled 
        as AS, BS, etc.&nbsp; They also have a label 'New' for a new addition to the 
        stack.&nbsp; When a subsequent acquisition does not not include all of the 
        currently displayed channels, that label will change to 'Old' for the channels 
        not included.</p>
    <p>The windows will be arranged in one or more columns to the right of the main 
      image display so as to maximum the zoom.&nbsp; The behavior is similar to that 
      with the side-by-side FFT.&nbsp; If the program window is resized, these windows 
      will be resized and may be rearranged.&nbsp; Resizing the right edge of a window 
      in the right-most or only column will change the amount of empty space to the 
      right of the windows, and resizing the bottom edge of a window in the bottom 
      row, or of the main window, will change the empty space below the windows.&nbsp; 
      Resizing at the junction between the main window and the multi-channel windows 
      will change the fractional allocation of available space between the two kinds 
      of windows.</p>
    <p>Closing any of the windows will close all of them.&nbsp; The windows will also 
      be closed when this dialog is closed with OK, when an FFT is taken (if the 
      option for side-by-side FFT display is on), and when settings are read in.</p>
      <P><A NAME="hid_window_all"></A><B>1, 2, ... command (Window menu)</B>
      <P>SerialEM displays a list of image windows at the bottom of the Window menu. A 
        check mark appears in front of the name of the active window. Choose a window 
        from this list to make it active.
