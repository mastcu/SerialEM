    <P><B>Low Dose Mode</B></P>
    <P>This check box turns low dose mode on or off. When low dose is turned on, the 
      current area is undefined unless the screen is down. When low dose is turned 
      off, the program returns to the Record area.</P>
    <P><B>Electron dose of current area</B></P>
    <P>If electron dose is calibrated, the dose will appear for the current area in the 
      upper right corner of the Low Dose panel. This dose will be updated 
      continuously when the 'Continuous update' option is selected and will also we 
      changed when the exposure time changes for the current area.</P>
    <P><B>Mag &amp; beam settings of current area</B></P>
    <P>The line will show the name of the current area and its magnification, spot 
      size, and brightness setting as given by a condenser lens strength or illuminated area. The 
      line is shown in black when the 'Continuous update' option is selected, to 
      signify that the values can be readily changed. Otherwise the line will be 
      grayed out and be hard to read.</P>
    <P><B>Continuous update (see tooltip)</B></P>
    <P>When this option is selected, any change of magnification, spot size, 
      brightness, energy filter settings, probe mode on an FEI scope, or alpha on a JEOL 
      scope will immediately change the parameters of 
      the current area. Otherwise, such changes will be lost when a new image is 
      acquired from the given area.&nbsp;  
      Beam shift, beam tilt, focus settings, and image shift displacements for a 
      particular area are <b>NOT</b> recorded when this option is on, but can be 
      introduced by other options in this panel. </P>
    <P><B>Define position of area</B></P>
    <P>Select Focus or Trial to adjust the position of these areas relative to the 
      Record area. (If 'Keep Focus and Trial identical' is selected, it does not 
      matter which area is selected here.) With one of these options selected, 
      SerialEM will try to display a marker point on the image in buffer A showing 
      the center of the area being defined. On a View image, it will also draw boxes 
      representing the Record area and the area being defined, as well as a circle 
      circumscribing the area being defined. You can adjust the position of the area 
      in 4 ways:
    </P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        by clicking with the left mouse button in a View image or in an image from the 
        area being defined;
      </LI>
      <LI>
        by entering a positive or negative distance in the 'Position on tilt axis' text 
        box;
      </LI>
      <LI>
        by shifting an image of the area being defined with the right mouse button 
        (although shifting a Record or View will still change image shift as usual);</LI>
      <LI>
        and even by adjusting image shift through microscope controls when the screen 
        is down.</LI></OL>
    <P>When you start defining an area, the area that will be shown when the screen is 
      down will be changed to the area being defined. The previous area to show will 
      be restored after you stop defining the area.</P>
    <P>You should select 'None' after adjusting the area to avoid inadvertent changes, 
      and to restore the expected behavior when shifting an image with the right 
      mouse button. Note that shifting the area being defined would change its offset 
      until defining is turned off.</P>
    <P><B>Position on Tilt Axis</B></P>
    <P>When the position of the Focus or Trial area is being defined, this text box 
      will show the center-to-center separation between that area and the Record 
      area. You can enter a number to set this distance as desired.</P>
    <P><B>Area separation</B></P>
    <P>When the position of an area is being defined, this line shows the minimum 
      separation between that area and the Record area. This separation is the 
      distance between the edge of a circle drawn just around the outside of the area 
      being defined, as defined by its camera parameters, and the edge of the Record 
      area as defined by its camera parameters. If 'Keep Focus and Trial identical' 
      is selected, the larger of the two areas will be used for this computation.</P>
    <P><a name="addedBeamShift"></a><b>Go to area buttons</b></P>
    <P>These buttons allow you to go to a particular area without taking an image.&nbsp; 
      The button for the current area is outlined in green.</P>
    <P><B>Additional beam shift (and possibly tilt)</B></a></P>
    <P>The controls in this box allow you to impose an independent beam shift for each 
      area relative to Record. You can use this to correct for imperfections in beam centering between 
      the different areas, such as due to mag changes or inadequacy in the coupling 
      between beam shift and image shift. You can also use it to shift the beam in 
      the Trial and Focus areas farther away from the Record area than it would be if 
      it were centered. To set beam shift for an area, 
      first be sure that the beam is centered in the Record area, then go to the 
      area of interest, turn on the 'Set' checkbox, move the beam to the desired 
      position and turn off 'Set'. At this point, if beam shift is calibrated, the 
      value of the shift will appear next to the 'Reset' button. This shift is in 
      microns and in specimen coordinates, where X is along the tilt axis. Press the 
      'Reset' button to return the shift of the current area to zero.&nbsp; </P>
    <P>If the 
      title line of this group box is <b>Additional beam shift (and tilt)</b>, a change in beam 
      tilt is also recorded at the same time as a change in beam shift, and it is 
      applied when changing between areas.&nbsp; (This feature is enabled by setting 
      the property &#39;LowDoseBeamTiltShifts&#39; in the properties file; as of SerialEM 
      3.4.0, it is no longer restricted to Trial and Focus areas). On FEI scopes, the 
      beam tilt recorded in this case would be adjusted by the Rotation Center 
      alignment.&nbsp; The &#39;Reset&#39; button will return these beam tilts to 0.</P>
    <P>For FEI scopes, Dark Field beam tilt provides a better way to adjust beam tilt 
      for the Trial and Focus areas; it is available as of SerialEM&nbsp; 3.6.0 (Dec 
      20, 2016) and the group box title will be <b>Additional beam shift (and DF tilt)</b> 
      unless the &#39;LowDoseBeamTiltShifts&#39; property is set.&nbsp; In this case, an 
      absolute setting is stored, not a difference between starting and ending values, 
      so the only the dark field state when &#39;Set&#39; is turned off matters.&nbsp; This 
      value is not reset when the &#39;Reset&#39; button is pressed (should it be?), so to 
      clear it out, just turn Dark Field off and turn &#39;Set&#39; on then off.&nbsp; This 
      feature may be useful for allowing larger image shift with a small objective 
      aperture on 300 KV Tecnais and Polaras.</P>
    <P>Beam shifts and tilts could be set for the Record area prior to SerialEM 3.6.0 
      and can no longer be, to avoid inadvertently setting undesired values for Record 
      and reduce confusion.&nbsp; Existing values from a previous version will be used 
      until they are cleared out with &#39;Reset&#39;.</P>
    <P><B>BLANK BEAM when screen down</B></P>
    <P>This option will prevent specimen exposure while the screen is down. It could be 
      useful for making an area be the current area without exposing the specimen. 
      You might want to do this to view or adjust its parameters. Ctrl-B is a hot key 
      for toggling this setting.</P>
    <P><B>Unblank button and blanked indicator</B></P>
    <P>The Unblank button can be used to unblank the beam until the next image 
      acquisition, which will restore blanking when it is done. (Other actions may 
      also turn the blanking back on.) The principal use of this button is to unblank 
      the beam before aligning an energy filter. To the right of the button, the text 
      'Blanked' will appear whenever the beam is blanked, even transiently during 
      exposures when not in low dose mode.
    </P>
    <P><B>Defocus offset for View or Search</B></P>
    <P>You can use this control to set an additional underfocus for the View or Search area, 
      depending on which radio button is selected. 
      Focus will be changed by this amount when going to the View or Search area 
      (e.g., by taking an image) and then will be restored when going to another area. For 
      example, if you have a focus target of -4 microns, set the offset to -8 to get 
      View images taken at -12 microns defocus.&nbsp; Be sure to align the View or 
      Search images 
      with the offset feature described next if you use very large defocus values.</P>
    <P>The defocus offset is applied after going to the magnification of the area; 
      thus it will be incremental to a focus change imposed by the microscope during 
      the magnification change.&nbsp; In particular, when going between nonLM and LM, 
      the microscope may restore the last defocus seen in the new magnification range, 
      and the offset is then applied to that.</P>
    <P><a name="viewShiftOffset"></a><B>Shift offset for View or Search</B></a></P>
    <P>If image features shift when going between the View or Search and Record areas, the <B>Set</B>
      button allows you to correct for this shift. The are two methods for setting the 
      shift offset: 1) applying a shift with the mouse button to bring the image in 
      buffer A into alignment with a reference image; 2) placing the green marker 
      point at corresponding locations in the images in buffers A and B.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Method 1 is more direct and potentially more accurate, but may be more 
      difficult.&nbsp; Method 2 is simple but depends on the accuracy of image shift 
      calibrations and may also depend on the accuracy of rotation angle and pixel 
      size calibrations.&nbsp; The Set button is enabled whenever there is a shift in 
      the A buffer for an image of the type 
      selected with the <b>View</b> or <b>Search</b> radio buttons, or whenever there 
      are marker points on images of appropriate types in buffers A and B. However, the <B>Set</B> 
      button should be pressed only if the shift in A brings the image into alignment with a Record or Preview image, 
      or if the makrers are indeed on corresponding points. 
      </P>
    <P><b><i>1) Setting shift offset with an alignment shift:</i></b> The procedure for setting a shift for View is:</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        In the Image Alignment &amp; Focus panel, turn off 'Move stage for big mouse 
        shifts' if it is on.&nbsp; (This step is optional if you are making a small 
        adjustment to an existing alignment, or if you shift the image in multiple steps 
        each too small to trigger a stage move.)</LI>
      <LI>
        Take a Record or Preview image and use the right mouse button to center a 
        feature that will be recognizable in the View image. Take another image to 
        verify that it is centered.</LI>
      <LI>
        Take a View image. Use the right mouse button to center the feature.&nbsp; 
        Do not take another image.</LI>
      <LI>
        Press <B>Set</B>. The shift will be recorded as a correction, and the program 
        will take a new View image, unless you skipped step 1 and your mouse shift 
        triggered a stage move.&nbsp; (In that case, the offset is correctly recorded, 
        but you will receive a message that you need to reset image shift and start with 
        a new Record image in order to check the offset.)</LI>
      <LI>
        If the new View image is not centered (such as if you are using a large defocus 
        offset or the image shift calibration is not good), center the feature and press         <b>Set</b> again. The new shift will be added to the existing one.&nbsp; Repeat 
        if necessary.</LI>
      <LI>
        Turn 'Move stage for big mouse shifts' back on if desired.</LI></OL>
    <P>The procedure is the same for setting the offset for Search, although here you 
      may want to use a View image instead of Record or Preview as your reference.&nbsp; 
      If so, be sure to align View with Record first.</P>
    <P><b><i>2) Setting shift offset with corresponding marker points:</i></b> The 
      images from a reference area and from the area whose offset is being set can be 
      taken in either order.&nbsp; To minimize the effect of inaccuracies in the 
      calibrations, try to pick the points near the center of the images, especially 
      for the reference image at higher magnification. </P>
    <ul>
      <li>To set an offset for View, you can have a View in A and a Record or Preview in 
        B; or you can have the View in B and the Record or Preview in A.</li>
      <li>To set an offset for Search, you can have a Search in A and a Record, Preview, 
        or View in B; or you can have the Search in B and the reference image in A.</li>
      <li>If you use a View as a reference image for setting the Search, set the View 
        offset first.</li>
      <li>Alignment shifts in the image buffer are not allowed with this procedure.&nbsp; 
        The <b>Set</b> button will be enabled even if there are such shifts, but 
        pressing it will bring up a message telling you to clear the shifts with the <b>
        Clear Alignment</b> button in the Image Alignment &amp; Focus control panel.&nbsp; 
        If the situation is ambiguous and the image in A could be used to set the offset 
        by method 1, then the message will give you that choice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b><i>General points:</i></b> Once an image has been used for setting the 
      offset, it cannot be used again; you need to acquire new images.</p>
    <P>If for some reason this shift offset becomes inappropriate, you can set it to 
      zero with the <B>Zero</B> button.&nbsp; However, do not zero out the shifts 
      after taking images for setting the shift and before setting the shift with them</P>
    <P>If the image shift offsets between magnifications are calibrated, this 
      adjustment will work together with that calibration. You can set this 
      adjustment with the option to 'Adjust image shift between mags' either on or 
      off. Once you have set an adjustment, it should work equally well if you turn 
      'Adjust image shift between mags' on or off.</P>
    <P><B>Normalize beam through View</B></P>
    <P>When this option is selected, changes in intensity and spot size when going 
      between areas will be normalized by passing through the View area intensity and 
      spot size. This normalization is intended to compensate for the lens hysteresis 
      that makes the beam position depend on the recent history of intensity changes, 
      a pronounced effect on 300 KeV JEOL scopes. With the option on, the beam 
      position in the Record area, for example, should be the same regardless of 
      whether the program has just come from the View area or has been going back and 
      forth between the Record and Trial/Focus areas. If different areas still have 
      different beam positions, use the option for setting 'Additional beam shift' 
      for some areas. It may be necessary to set the property LowDoseBeamNormDelay to 
      a higher value for maximum effect.</P>
    <P><B>Keep Focus and Trial identical</B></P>
    <P>When this option is selected, the parameters of the Focus and Trial areas will 
      be kept the same in all respects. It is desirable for these areas to be in the 
      same location because of the large settling time that would be required after 
      moving the beam from one side of the Record area to the other, and because of 
      the limited space inside the objective aperture on the 300 KV Tecnai or Polara. You might 
      want different brightness settings, in which case you would have this option 
      selected while positioning the areas, then unselected to adjust the brightness 
      of one.</P>
    <P><B>Copy current area mag &amp; beam to </B>
    </P>
    <P>These buttons will copy the exposure parameters (but not the location) of the 
      current area to one of the 5 areas: View, Focus, Trial, Record, or Search. This would 
      be useful mostly when initially setting up the areas. Because they are easily 
      mistaken for acquisition buttons, a message box will appear asking you to 
      confirm the copy.</P>
    <P><B>Center Unshifted</B></P>
    <P>When you push this button, the View and Record areas will be set to have no 
      image shift relative to the center of the viewing area. and the Focus and Trial 
      areas will be displaced by the full amount of their image shifts from the 
      center of the viewing area In other words, when the overall image shift (as 
      reported in the Scope Status panel) is reset to zero, the Record area will be 
      at a true image shift of zero. When this button or the 'Balance Shift' button 
      is pressed, the image shift reading in the Scope Status panel will change to 
      reflect the change in the center of image shift coordinates, but the same area 
      will appear if a new picture is taken.
    </P>
    <P><B>Balance Shifts</B></P>
    <P>When you push this button, the image shift of the Focus and Trial areas will be 
      divided between those areas and the Record area. The Record will be displaced 
      to one side of the center of the viewing area, and the Focus and trial areas to 
      the other side (assuming they are on the same side). This means that when image 
      shift is reset to zero, there will actually be substantial image shift when 
      viewing the Record area.</P>
    <P><B>Rotate inter-area axis</B></P>
    <P>Select this option to rotate the axis between the View/Record areas and the 
      Trial/Focus areas away from the tilt axis. Enter the angle of rotation in the 
      text box (CCW positive). All of the features described above for defining the 
      location of the Trial/Focus areas work the same, except that the location is 
      forced to be along this rotated axis instead of along the tilt axis. Although 
      this feature was added to assist with acquisition from multiple locations on an 
      untilted specimen, autofocusing on a tilted specimen should work correctly 
      because it is compensated for the difference in Z height between the focus area 
      and the tilt axis.</P>
