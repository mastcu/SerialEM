    <P><B>Low Dose Mode</B></P>
    <P>This check box turns low dose mode on or off. When low dose is turned on, the
      current area is undefined unless the screen is down. When low dose is turned
      off, the program returns to the Record area.</P>
    <P><B>Electron dose of current area</B></P>
    <P>If electron dose is calibrated, the dose will appear for the current area in the
      upper right corner of the Low Dose panel. This dose will be updated
      continuously when the 'Continuous update' option is selected and will also we
      changed when the exposure time changes for the current area.</P>
    <P><B>Mag &amp; beam settings of current area</B></P>
    <P>The line will show the name of the current area and its magnification, spot
      size, and brightness setting as given by a condenser lens strength or illuminated area. The
      line is shown in black when the 'Continuous update' option is selected, to
      signify that the values can be readily changed. Otherwise the line will be
      grayed out and be hard to read.</P>
    <P><B>Continuous update (see tooltip)</B></P>
    <P>When this option is selected, any change of magnification, spot size,
      brightness, diffraction focus in diffraction mode, energy filter settings, probe mode on a Thermo/FEI scope, or alpha on a JEOL
      scope will immediately change the parameters of
      the current area. Otherwise, such changes will be lost when a new image is
      acquired from the given area, except for intensity changes made with
        <a href="menu_tasks.htm#hid_process_setintensity">Set Intensity</a> or
        <a href="menu_tasks.htm#hid_tasks_set_dose_rate">Set Dose Rate</a> in the Tasks
        menu.&nbsp;
      Beam shift, beam tilt, focus settings in imaging mode, and image shift displacements for a
      particular area are <b>NOT</b> recorded when this option is on, but can be
      introduced by other options in this panel. </P>
    <P>Usually, if you have already changed some microscope settings, those changes 
      will be incorporated into the current area when turning this option on.&nbsp; 
      However, when the current area is View or Search and either the probe mode has 
      been changed or the magnification has crossed the LM-nonLM boundary, the program 
      needs to reassert the pre-existing area parameters to prevent defocus from 
      getting off.&nbsp; For these two areas, these kinds of changes can be made only 
      after this option is turned on. </P>
    <P><B>Define position of area</B></P>
    <P>Select Focus or Trial to adjust the position of these areas relative to the
      Record area. (If 'Keep Focus and Trial identical' is selected, it does not
      matter which area is selected here.) With one of these options selected,
      SerialEM will try to display a marker point on the image in buffer A showing
      the center of the area being defined. On a View image, it will also draw boxes
      representing the Record area and the area being defined, as well as a circle
      circumscribing the area being defined. You can adjust the position of the area
      in 4 ways:
    </P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        By clicking with the left mouse button in a View image or in an image from the
        area being defined.&nbsp; A View image can be in any buffer or even read in from a
          file; an image of the area being defined must be in buffer A;
      </LI>
      <LI>
        By drawing a line anywhere in a View image, including one read from a file, by 
        holding down the Shift key and the left mouse button while moving the mouse.&nbsp; 
        The line defines a vector that specifies a position relative to the image 
        center. In effect, the line is shifted so that its starting point is at the 
        center and its end point is then turned into a marker point that is treated just 
        like in 1).</LI>
      <LI>
        By entering a positive or negative distance in the 'Position on tilt axis' text
        box; </LI>
      <LI>
        By shifting an image of the area being defined with the right mouse button
        (although shifting a Record or View will still change image shift as usual);</LI>
      <LI>
        And even by adjusting image shift through microscope controls when the screen
        is down.</LI>
      </OL>
      <P>When you click in a View image, the behavior depends on whether the axis between
          areas is free to rotate away from the tilt axis, with the 'Rotate interarea
          axis' option. If that option is off, the marked position will be projected onto the
          tilt axis and that projection will define
          the distance of the area along the axis.&nbsp; If the option is on, the marked
          position will be used as is, changing both the angle of the axis and the
          location on the axis.&nbsp; When you click in an image of the area being
          defined, the axis rotation is not changed, and the clicked point is projected
          onto the interarea axis.</P>
      <P>You should select 'None' after adjusting the area to avoid inadvertent changes,
      and to restore the expected behavior when setting the marker or shifting an image with the right
      mouse button. Note that shifting the area being defined would change its offset
      until defining is turned off.</P>
    <P><B>Position on Tilt Axis</B></P>
    <P>When the position of the Focus or Trial area is being defined, this text box
      will show the center-to-center separation between that area and the Record
      area. You can enter a number to set this distance as desired.</P>
    <P><B>Area separation</B></P>
    <P>When the position of an area is being defined, this line shows the minimum
      separation between that area and the Record area. This separation is the
      distance between the edge of a circle drawn just around the outside of the area
      being defined, as defined by its camera parameters, and the edge of the Record
      area as defined by its camera parameters. If 'Keep Focus and Trial identical'
      is selected, the larger of the two areas will be used for this computation.</P>
    <P><a name="addedBeamShift"></a><b>Go to area buttons</b></P>
    <P>These buttons allow you to go to a particular area without taking an image.&nbsp;
      The button for the current area is outlined in green.</P>
    <P><B>Additional beam shift (and possibly tilt)</B></a></P>
    <P>The controls in this box allow you to impose an independent beam shift for each
      area relative to Record. You can use this to correct for imperfections in beam centering between
      the different areas, such as due to mag changes or inadequacy in the coupling
      between beam shift and image shift. You can also use it to shift the beam in
      the Trial and Focus areas farther away from the Record area than it would be if
      it were centered. To set beam shift for an area,
      first be sure that the beam is centered in the Record area, then go to the
      area of interest, turn on the 'Set' checkbox, move the beam to the desired
      position and turn off 'Set'. At this point, if beam shift is calibrated, the
      value of the shift will appear next to the 'Reset' button. This shift is in
      microns and in specimen coordinates, where X is along the tilt axis. Press the
      'Reset' button to return the shift of the current area to zero.&nbsp; </P>
    <P>If the
      title line of this group box is <b>Additional beam shift (and tilt)</b>, a change in beam
      tilt is also recorded at the same time as a change in beam shift, and it is
      applied when changing between areas.&nbsp; (This feature is enabled by setting
      the property &#39;LowDoseBeamTiltShifts&#39; in the properties file; as of SerialEM
      3.4, it is no longer restricted to Trial and Focus areas). On Thermo/FEI scopes, the
      beam tilt recorded in this case would be adjusted by the Rotation Center
      alignment.&nbsp; The &#39;Reset&#39; button will return these beam tilts to 0.</P>
    <P>For Thermo/FEI scopes, Dark Field beam tilt provides a better way to adjust beam tilt
      for the Trial and Focus areas; it is available as of SerialEM&nbsp; 3.6 and the group box title will be <b>Additional beam shift (and DF tilt)</b>
      unless the &#39;LowDoseBeamTiltShifts&#39; property is set.&nbsp; In this case, an
      absolute setting is stored, not a difference between starting and ending values,
      so the only the dark field state when &#39;Set&#39; is turned off matters.&nbsp; This
      value is not reset when the &#39;Reset&#39; button is pressed (should it be?), so to
      clear it out, just turn Dark Field off and turn &#39;Set&#39; on then off.&nbsp; This
      feature may be useful for allowing larger image shift with a small objective
      aperture on 300 KV Tecnais and Polaras.</P>
    <P>Beam shifts and tilts could be set for the Record area prior to SerialEM 3.6
      and can no longer be, to avoid inadvertently setting undesired values for Record
      and reduce confusion.&nbsp; Existing values from a previous version will be used
      until they are cleared out with &#39;Reset&#39;.</P>
    <P><B>Defocus offsets for View and Search</B></P>
    <P>You can use these controls to set an additional underfocus for the View or Search area.
      Focus will be changed by this amount when going to the View or Search area
      (e.g., by taking an image) and then will be restored when going to another area. For
      example, if you have a focus target of -4 microns, set the offset to -8 to get
      View images taken at -12 microns defocus.&nbsp; Be sure to align the View or
      Search images
      with the offset feature described next if you use very large defocus values.</P>
    <P>The defocus offset is applied after going to the magnification of the area;
      thus it will be incremental to a focus change imposed by the microscope during
      the magnification change.&nbsp; In particular, when going between nonLM and LM,
      the microscope may restore the last defocus seen in the new magnification range,
      and the offset is then applied to that.</P>
      <P>Defocus offsets are disabled in diffraction mode.&nbsp; An absolute diffraction focus value is recorded as part of the area settings, and can be modified when continuous update is turned on.&nbsp; This absolute value is restored whenever going back to an area in diffraction mode.</P>
    <P><a name="viewShiftOffset"></a><B>Shift offsets for View and Search</B></a></P>
    <P>If image features shift when going between the View or Search and Record areas, 
      one of the <B>Set</B>
      buttons allows you to correct for this shift. There are two methods for setting the
      shift offset: 1) using image shift to align an image in buffer A with a reference image, 
      which can be done manually by applying a shift with the mouse button or 
      automatically with the <strong>Auto</strong> button; 2) placing the green marker
      point at corresponding locations in the images in buffers A and B.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Method 1 is more direct and potentially more accurate, but may be more
      difficult to do manually.&nbsp; Method 2 is simple but depends on the accuracy of image shift
      calibrations and may also depend on the accuracy of rotation angle and pixel
      size calibrations.&nbsp; The <strong>Set</strong> button for View or Search is enabled whenever there is a shifted 
      View or Search in
      the A buffer, respectively, or whenever there
      are marker points on images of appropriate types in buffers A and B. However, the <B>Set</B>
      button should be pressed only if the shift in A brings the image into alignment with a Record or Preview image,
      or if the markers are indeed on corresponding points.
      </P>
    <P><strong><em>1) Setting shift offset automatically:</em></strong> When you press 
      the <strong>Auto</strong> button for View, the program will take a Preview then a 
      View image, attempt to align them and set the shift offset, then take another 
      View to refine the offset.&nbsp; With the Search <strong>Auto</strong> button, 
      it will take a View if it has a higher magnification than Search, otherwise it 
      will take Preview, then take Search images to align.&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, 
      it will scale down the higher-magnification image and crop out as much of the 
      lower-magnification image as is needed to find the maximum shift with full 
      overlap between the two images.&nbsp; The cropped image is left in buffer A and 
      the scaled down image in buffer B, so you can toggle between them to assess 
      whether they are correctly aligned.&nbsp; Image
      shift is reset at the start if it exceeds 0.5 micron (this threshold can be set with the property 
      LDShiftOffsetResetISThresh).&nbsp; The alignment is iterated if the image shift of the
      first alignment exceeds 0.1 micron (a limit set with the property 
      LDShiftOffsetIterThresh).&nbsp; The <strong>Zero</strong> button is 
      labeled <strong>Undo</strong> after setting a shift automatically, and you can 
      use that button to revert to the previous offset if necessary.&nbsp; Only the 
      last shift done can be reverted.&nbsp; There are two important points about the 
      automatic aligment:</P>
    <ul>
      <li><em>There must be a well-defined feature in the higher-magnification image 
        that is unique and easily recognizable in the lower-magnification one, and 
        within the central half of that image</em> (unless the maximum allowed shift has 
        been set differently from the default; see <strong>Setup Auto Shift</strong> 
        below). </li>
      <li>Be sure to find the View offset before the Search offset (butthis does not 
        matter if Search is at a higher magnification than View).</li>
    </ul>
    <P><b><i>2) Setting shift offset with an alignment shift:</i></b> The procedure for setting a shift for View is:</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        In the Image Alignment &amp; Focus panel, turn off 'Move stage for big mouse
        shifts' if it is on.&nbsp; (This step is optional if you are making a small
        adjustment to an existing alignment, or if you shift the image in multiple steps
        each too small to trigger a stage move.)</LI>
      <LI>
        Take a Record or Preview image and use the right mouse button to center a
        feature that will be recognizable in the View image. Take another image to
        verify that it is centered.</LI>
      <LI>
        Take a View image. Use the right mouse button to center the feature.&nbsp;
        Do not take another image.</LI>
      <LI>
        Press <B>Set</B>. The shift will be recorded as a correction, and the program
        will take a new View image, unless you skipped step 1 and your mouse shift
        triggered a stage move.&nbsp; (In that case, the offset is correctly recorded,
        but you will receive a message that you need to reset image shift and start with
        a new Record image in order to check the offset.)</LI>
      <LI>
        If the new View image is not centered (such as if you are using a large defocus
        offset or the image shift calibration is not good), center the feature and press 
        <b>Set</b> again. The new shift will be added to the existing one.&nbsp; Repeat
        if necessary.</LI>
      <LI>
        Turn 'Move stage for big mouse shifts' back on if desired.</LI></OL>
    <P>The procedure is the same for setting the offset for Search, although here you
      may want to use a View image instead of Record or Preview as your reference.&nbsp;
      If so, be sure to align View with Record first.</P>
    <P><b><i>3) Setting shift offset with corresponding marker points:</i></b> The
      images from a reference area and from the area whose offset is being set can be
      taken in either order.&nbsp; To minimize the effect of inaccuracies in the
      calibrations, try to pick the points near the center of the images, especially
      for the reference image at higher magnification. </P>
    <ul>
      <li>To set an offset for View, you can have a View in A and a Record or Preview in
        B; or you can have the View in B and the Record or Preview in A.</li>
      <li>To set an offset for Search, you can have a Search in A and a Record, Preview,
        or View in B; or you can have the Search in B and the reference image in A.</li>
      <li>If you use a View as a reference image for setting the Search, set the View
        offset first.</li>
      <li>Alignment shifts in the image buffer are not allowed with this procedure.&nbsp;
        The <b>Set</b> button will be enabled even if there are such shifts, but
        pressing it will bring up a message telling you to clear the shifts with the <b>
        Clear Alignment</b> button in the Image Alignment &amp; Focus control panel.&nbsp;
        If the situation is ambiguous and the image in A could be used to set the offset
        by method 1, then the message will give you that choice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b><i>General points:</i></b> Once an image has been used for setting the
      offset, it cannot be used again; you need to acquire new images.</p>
    <P>If for some reason this shift offset becomes inappropriate, you can set it to
      zero with the <B>Zero</B> button.&nbsp; However, do not zero out the shifts
      after taking images for setting the shift and before setting the shift with them.</P>
    <P>If the image shift offsets between magnifications are calibrated, this
      adjustment will work together with that calibration. You can set this
      adjustment with the option to 'Adjust image shift between mags' either on or
      off. Once you have set an adjustment, it should work equally well if you turn
      'Adjust image shift between mags' on or off.</P>
    <P><a name="setupAutoShift"><strong>Setup Auto Shift</strong></P>
    <P>Use this button to set parameters for automatically finding shift offsets.&nbsp; 
      Currently there are four parameters and they are specified in sequential entry 
      boxes; canceling in any of them will leave that one and the later ones 
      unchanged.</P>
    <ol>
      <li>For measuring the View shift offset, enter the maximum microns of shift 
        allowed as a positive value, or the negative of a fraction of the field of view 
        of the View image corresponding to the desired maximum shift.&nbsp; For example, 
        -0.25 constrains it to finding the center of the Preview within the central half 
        of the View image.&nbsp; This is the initial default value.</li>
      <li>For measuring the Search shift offset, enter the maximum microns of shift 
        allowed as a positive value, or the negative of a fraction of the field of view 
        of the Search image corresponding to this maximum shift.</li>
      <li>Enter the maximum percent size change allowed in the search when trying to 
        align the cropped image to the scaled-up image.&nbsp; The default is set by the 
        property &#39;ScaledAliDfltPctChg&#39; (which itself has a default of 4%) and you will 
        continue to use a value based on the property setting until you set a different 
        value.&nbsp; You can return to using the property-based default with an entry of 
        -1.</li>
      <li>Enter the maximum rotation angle allowed in the search when trying to align 
        the cropped image to the scaled-up image.&nbsp; The default is set by the 
        property &#39;ScaledAliDfltMaxRot&#39; (which itself has a default of 3 degrees) and you 
        will continue to use a value based on the property setting until you set a 
        different value.&nbsp; You can return to using the property-based default with 
        an entry of -1.</li>
    </ol>
    <P><B>Blanked indicator</B></P>
    <P>The beam is kept blanked in Low Dose mode when the screen is up.&nbsp; Next to 
      the Options button, the text &#39;Blanked&#39; will appear whenever the beam is blanked, 
      even transiently during exposures when not in low dose mode.&nbsp; Blanking and 
      unblanking can be done with the button in the Microscope Control panel.</P>
    <P><B>BLANK BEAM when screen down</B></P>
    <P>This option will prevent specimen exposure while the screen is down. Ctrl-B is a hot key
      for toggling this setting.</P>
    <P><B>Normalize beam through View / Normalize condenser lenses</B></P>
    <P>This option will appear in one of two forms depending on whether there is an
      entry for NormCondenserInLowDose in SerialEMproperties.txt.&nbsp; </P>
    <P>When the option
      is <B>Normalize beam through View</B>
      and is selected, changes in intensity and spot size when going
      between some areas will be normalized by passing through the View area intensity and
      spot size. This initial change will not be done will be done when going to the
      Search area or going between areas with identical beam settings.&nbsp; This normalization is intended to compensate for the lens hysteresis
      that makes the beam position depend on the recent history of intensity changes,
      a pronounced effect on 300 KeV JEOL scopes. With the option on, the beam
      position in the Record area, for example, should be the same regardless of
      whether the program has just come from the View area or has been going back and
      forth between the Record and Trial/Focus areas. If different areas still have
      different beam positions, use the option for setting 'Additional beam shift'
      for some areas. It may be necessary to set the property LowDoseBeamNormDelay to
      a higher value for maximum effect.</P>
    <P>When the option is <strong>Normalize Condenser Lenses</strong> and is selected,
      the microscope routine for normalizing condenser lenses will be called when
      changing areas, except when going to View or Search, or when going between areas
      with identical beam settings.&nbsp; Again, the property LowDoseBeamNormDelay may
      need to be set to a higher value for the best result.</P>
    <P>Note that the value of NormCondenserInLowDose can be changed with the
      SetProperty script command, but the label here will not change.</P>
    <P><B>Keep Focus and Trial identical</B></P>
    <P>When this option is selected, the parameters of the Focus and Trial areas will
      be kept the same in all respects. It is desirable for these areas to be in the
      same location because of the large settling time that would be required after
      moving the beam from one side of the Record area to the other, and because of
      the limited space inside the objective aperture on the 300 KV Tecnai or Polara. You might
      want different brightness settings, in which case you would have this option
      selected while positioning the areas, then unselected to adjust the brightness
      of one.</P>
    <P><B>Copy current area settings to V - F - T - R - S</B></P>
    <P>These buttons will generally copy all properties except the axis position from the
      current area to one of the 5 areas: View, Focus, Trial, Record, or Search.&nbsp;
      When copying between View and Search, the defocus and shift offsets are copied
      as well.&nbsp; When copying to Record, the beam shift and tilt offsets will be
      set to zero rather than copied, since Record is supposed to be the reference for
      these offsets.&nbsp; Copy would
      be useful mostly when initially setting up the areas. Because they are easily
      mistaken for the &#39;Go to area&#39; buttons, a message box will appear asking you to
      confirm the copy.</P>
    <P><B>Balance Shifts/Center Unshifted</B></P>
    <P>When this button is labeled <strong>Balance Shifts</strong>, pressing it will 
      make the image shift of the Focus and Trial areas be
      divided between those areas and the Record area. The Record will be displaced
      to one side of the center of the viewing area, and the Focus and Trial areas to
      the other side (assuming they are on the same side). This means that when image
      shift is reset to zero, there will actually be substantial image shift in the 
      microscope when
      viewing the Record area.&nbsp; When shifts are balanced, the button is green and 
      labeled Center Unshifted, and pressing it will restore the unshifted condition: 
      i.e., with Record in the center of the viewing area and Focus and Trial areas 
      displaced by the full amount of their image shifts from the center of the 
      viewing area.&nbsp; When this button is pressed, the image shift reading 
      in the Scope Status panel will change to reflect the change in the center of 
      image shift coordinates, but the same area will appear if a new picture is 
      taken. </P>
    <P><B>Rotate inter-area axis</B></P>
    <P>Select this option to rotate the axis between the View/Record areas and the
      Trial/Focus areas away from the tilt axis. Enter the angle of rotation in the
      text box (CCW positive). All of the features described above for defining the
      location of the Trial/Focus areas work the same, except that the location is
      forced to be along this rotated axis instead of along the tilt axis. Although
      this feature was added to assist with acquisition from multiple locations on an
      untilted specimen, autofocusing on a tilted specimen should work correctly
      because it is compensated for the difference in Z height between the focus area
      and the tilt axis.</P>
