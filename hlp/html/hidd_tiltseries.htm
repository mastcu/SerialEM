      <P>This complex dialog box allows you to set all of the parameters for a tilt 
        series. Some of the parameters that can be changed here can also be set through 
        other menu or control panel options. When you first open this dialog, the 
        program makes some assumptions to set some initial values, but you are able to 
        change all values. If you have already started a tilt series, many of the 
        options will be disabled. For an overview and a list of steps commonly used in 
        starting a tilt series, see the section on <A HREF="about_tilt_series.htm">Acquiring 
          Tilt Series</A>. Differences in operation in STEM mode are all described in a 
        section at the end, <A HREF="#tss_stem">Tilt Series in STEM Mode</A>.</P>
        <P>The dialog entries are organized into the following groups:</P>

      <P>Each of the groups (except the buttons on the bottom) can be opened and closed 
        independently with the small +/- button in the upper left corner. In addition, 
        the dialog control buttons allow you to step from one group to the next or to 
        show the left side, the right side, or the full dialog (see <A HREF="#tss_action_buttons">
          Dialog Control and Action Buttons</A> ). Each time that you open the 
        dialog, it will be appear in a form similar to way you last left it: with the 
        full dialog if the full dialog was showing before; with the left half if one 
        half was showing before, otherwise with the first group open.</P>
      <P><i><A NAME="tss_tilt_angle"></A><B><FONT size="3">Tilt Angle Specifications</FONT></B></i></P>
      <P>This grouping contains various controls related to tilting and tilt angle. The 
        increment, delay time, and choice of cosine tilting duplicate the entries that 
        can be made through the <A HREF="hidd_tiltcontrol.htm">Tilt Control panel</A> .</P>
      <P><B>Start at</B></P>
      <P>Enter the starting tilt angle in this text box. If you are already at high tilt 
        when you first start the setup dialog, the box will show the current tilt 
        angle; otherwise it will contain a default angle. After a tilt series is 
        started, this value cannot be changed. The starting tilt angle can be positive 
        or negative.</P>
      <P><B>End at</B></P>
      <P>Enter the ending tilt angle in this text box. When you first start the setup 
        dialog, this box will contain the negative of the value in the starting tilt 
        angle text box. The ending angle can be changed at any time.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Swap</STRONG></P>
      <P>Use this button to exchange the starting and ending tilt angles in the two text 
        boxes.</P>
      <P><B>Base Increment</B></P>
      <P>Enter the basic tilt increment in this text box. If you have chosen to tilt with 
        a fixed increment, this value will be that increment. If you have chosen to 
        have increments proportional to the cosine of the angle, this value will be the 
        increment at zero tilt, and the increment will be progressively smaller at 
        higher angles.</P>
      <P><B>Increment proportional to cosine of angle</B></P>
      <P>Select this option to have tilt increments proportional to the cosine of the 
        tilt angle. The increment would have its basic value at zero tilt, half of that 
        at 60 degrees, and one-third of it at 70 degrees.</P>
      <P><B>Total # of tilts</B></P>
      <P>This status message will show the total number tilts for the given starting and 
        ending angles, increment, and choice of regular or cosine tilting. If you make 
        a change in one of the text boxes, this message will be updated when you leave 
        the text box.</P>
    <P> <b>Run series in two directions from</b></P>
    <P>Turning on this option 
      will result in a bidirectional series that starts at the angle indicated in the text box, 
      tilts up to the angle in the <b>Start at</b> text box (now labeled <b>Tilt to</b>), returns to the 
      starting angle, and tilts to the ending angle.&nbsp; If you want the series to 
      start at an intermediate angle and go through zero degrees in the first segment, 
      you must put an angle of the right sign in the text box (the same sign as the 
      ending angle).&nbsp; The program will take a lower magnification &#39;anchor&#39; image 
      at the starting angle before it starts, and then realign to this image when it 
      returns to the starting angle. Another special feature of this acquisition 
      method is that if an image that is too dim is encountered at a high tilt in the 
      first part of the tilt series, the first part will be ended and the second part 
      begun automatically.&nbsp; By default, this happens if the angle is at least 55 
      degrees or within 5 degrees of the <b>Tilt to</b> angle, settings that can be 
      adjusted in the <a href="hidd_tspolicies.htm">Tilt Series Batch 
      Policies dialog box</a>. </P>
    <P><b>Return with Walk Up</b></P>
    <P>By default, the program will return to the starting angle of a bidirectional 
      series by tilting back in steps and restoring the stage position and image shift 
      at which the anchor was taken, with adjustments for backlash if possible.&nbsp; 
      However, if Return with Walk Up is checked, it will use the Walk Up task to 
      return instead, but it will still realign to the anchor.&nbsp; This option 
      should be used only if necessary.&nbsp; Particularly in Low Dose mode, there is 
      some risk of failed correlations in the Walk Up procedure, as well as a risk 
      that the position has already gotten off in the last few tilts.&nbsp; In fact, 
      when the first part of the series is ended because of a dim image, the program 
      assumes that the position is compromised and returns with steps even if Walk Up 
      was selected.&nbsp; The main reason for using Walk Up would be if it is too 
      difficult to get an anchor image with a large enough field of view.</P>
    <P> <b>Magnification for anchor</b></P>
    <P>The magnification of the bidirectional anchor is selected with the spin 
      button; the field of view at that magnification is shown to the right of the 
      spin button.&nbsp; This magnification will be initialized to give at least an 8 
      micron field of view. This large a field of view may be necessary because the 
      realignment to the anchor occurs after a large tilt and a long time interval 
      after the anchor was acquired. The field of view will be shown in bold with two 
      stars if it falls below 8 microns, and with 4 stars if it falls below 6 microns.&nbsp; 
      (The property &#39;TSBidirAnchorMinField&#39; can be used to set different criteria.) </P>
    <P> <b>Use View for anchor</b></P>
    <P>When this option is checked, a View image will be used for the bidirectional anchor 
      in Low Dose mode.&nbsp; If it is unchecked, then the program will allow you to 
      select a magnification for Low Dose mode that is less than that of a View image, 
      and it will use View parameters as the basis for taking that image.&nbsp; Do not 
      assume that a View image will be reliable for the anchor just because it works 
      for other operations.</P>
      <P><B>Delay time after tilting by basic increment</B></P>
      <P>Enter a delay time in seconds in this text box. This delay will be applied 
        before taking an image, but only under certain circumstances, i.e, when taking 
        an image with the Record parameter set, when autofocusing, and when finding 
        eucentricity.</P>
      <P><B>Change some settings as a function of angle</B></P>
      <P>Select this option if you want to make scheduled changes in some parameters at 
        various points in the tilt series. The parameters that can be changed include 
        Record exposure time and drift settling time, the target for autofocusing, and 
        energy loss and slit width when using an energy filter. If you have already 
        defined some changes, this option must be selected for them to be used during 
        the series.</P>
      <P><B>Set Changes</B></P>
      <P>Once you have enabled the use of scheduled changes with the adjacent check box, 
        use this button to set, adjust, or view the changes in the <A HREF="hidd_tsvariations.htm">
          Tilt Series Scheduled Changes dialog box</A> .</P>
      <P><A NAME="tss_size_shift"></A><i><B><FONT size="3">Size, Image Shift, and Recentering 
            Specifications</FONT></B></i></P>
      <P><B>Magnification</B></P>
      <P>Use the up and down arrows to change the magnification at which the tilt series 
        will be obtained. When you first start the setup dialog, the current microscope 
        magnification will be shown. If you change microscope magnification after 
        starting a tilt series (or indeed, after leaving this dialog box with a 
        magnification value set), the Tilt Series Controller will automatically restore 
        the magnification when it resumes operation. If you are montaging, the 
        magnification cannot be changed through this dialog box, only through the <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">
          Montage Setup dialog box</A> .</P>
      <P><B>Binning</B></P>
      <P>This control shows the current binning of the Record parameter set. You can use 
        the up and down arrows to change the binning (unless you are montaging). If you 
        do change the binning, the exposure time will be changed accordingly, but you 
        will be offered the chance to check exposure and drift settings before starting 
        the tilt series.</P>
      <P><B>Pixel size</B></P>
      <P>The status message shows the pixel size, given the magnification and binning.</P>
      <P><B>Track at lower magnification when needed</B></P>
      <P>Select this option to have tracking images taken at a lower magnification at the 
        start of the tilt series, or at other times when the Tilt Series Controller 
        thinks that tracking at the regular magnification might fail, such as after 
        resetting image shift. With the option selected, you can adjust the 
        magnification for the tracking images with the up and down arrows. Choose a 
        magnification where tracking occurs reliably.</P>
      <P><B>Limit image shift</B></P>
      <P>Enter the maximum image shift that should be allowed to accumulate before the 
        program resets image shifts.</P>
      <P><B>Recenter beam from Low Dose tracking images</B></P>
      <P>This option is available in Low Dose mode for keeping the beam centered during a 
        tilt series. When the program takes a new track reference or a tracking image 
        before a Record, it will call the beam centering routine used with the <A HREF="menu_tasks.htm#hid_tasks_centerbeam">
          Center Beam command</A> . However, the beam will be moved only if the 
        radius of the circle fit to detected beam edge is less than 90% of the diagonal 
        distance from the center to a corner of the image, and if the error of the fit 
        is less than 3% of this distance. These restrictions are an attempt to avoid 
        mis-centering the beam when the edge of a grid bar is in the image. To use this 
        option, you should set the intensity for the Trial area so the beam edges 
        occupy all four corners; a size midway between those of the circumscribed and 
        the inscribed circles should work.&nbsp; If necessary, the maximum radius 
        allowed can be changed with the property TSTrialCenterMaxRadFrac, which is 0.45 
        by default.</P>
      <P><B>Autocenter beam every X minutes</B></P>
      <P>Select this option to have the beam autocentering routine that is used with the <A HREF="menu_tasks.htm#hid_tasks_autocenterbeam">
          Autocenter Beam command</A> run periodically during a tilt series. The 
        option is available if autocentering has been set up for the magnification and 
        camera being used for the series. Enter the interval in minutes between 
        autocentering runs in the adjacent text box. The first interval is counted from 
        the beginning of the tilt series because it is assumed that the beam was 
        centered either manually or with autocentering just before the series.</P>
      <P><B>Autocenter beam in second half of series at X degrees</B></P>
      <P>Select this option to have the beam autocentering routine run once when the tilt 
        series crosses back above the angle specified in the text box. This option 
        allows the beam to be centered before it becomes constricted at high angles. 
        Enter a positive angle even if angles are negative the second half of the 
        series.</P>
      <P><B>Refine zero-loss peak</B></P>
      <P>If you have an energy filter, this option is available to refine the alignment 
        of the zero-loss peak periodically during the tilt series. After selecting the 
        option, enter the interval in minutes between refinements. The refinement will 
        be done with a series of highly binned, low-exposure pictures. In low-dose 
        mode, the pictures are taken at the Record area and are based on the Preview 
        parameters, but with even lower exposure if possible.</P>
      <P><i><A NAME="tss_beam_control"></A><B><FONT size="3">Beam Intensity Control</FONT></B></i></P>
      <P>This grouping controls how the specimen exposure will be changed during the tilt 
        series. For a typical thick section, the transmitted intensity will decrease by 
        a factor of 2-3 at the highest tilts unless the beam intensity is changed to 
        compensate. Traditionally, SerialEM has used changes in beam intensity 
        (brightness, C2 or illuminated area on FEI scopes, or C3 on JEOL) to 
        compensate for changes in 
        beam attenuation. It is now also possible to have exposure time changed 
        instead. Changing exposure time only will leave the beam in a constant state, 
        which would allow one to stay in parallel illumination. However, increasing 
        exposure time may lead to drift in the images, and for plastic sections, it 
        will generally require longer drift settling times.&nbsp; If you have a direct 
        electron detector, changing exposure time presents additional complications 
        because it may be constrained to be a multiple of a certain value.</P>
      <P><B>Change Record exposure time instead of beam intensity</B></P>
      <P>Select this option to vary the exposure time of Record images instead of beam 
        intensity to achieve whatever control of specimen exposure is specified in the 
        options below this. With this alternative, the program will use interpolation 
        between dark references, if possible, to avoid having to take a new dark 
        reference for each image. This is the same interpolation that can be activated 
        with the <A HREF="menu_camera.htm#hid_camera_interpolate_dark_refs">Interpolate 
          Dark Refs command</A> in the Camera menu, and the program will try to use 
        this feature regardless of whether you have selected it in that menu. However, 
        interpolation cannot be used if you are not gain-normalizing images in 
        SerialEM, and in that case a dark reference will be taken for each Record image 
        if this option is selected.
      </P>
      <P>This option is not available if you have scheduled changes in exposure time, 
        which means that both exposure time and intensity might change during the 
        series. Specifically, you might have a set of discrete exposure changes that 
        occur at intervals during the series. Between those changes, the beam intensity 
        will be changed to achieve whatever control of specimen exposure you have 
        specified. When the exposure time changes, the beam intensity will be changed to 
        compensate and maintain the desired specimen exposure.</P>
    <P>If you have a K2 camera, this option is problematic because the exposure time 
      is constrained to a multiple of 0.1 sec or 0.5 sec in counting or 
      super-resolution mode without Dose Fractionation, or to a multiple of the frame 
      time with Dose Fractionation on.&nbsp; With such constraints, the program will 
      likely not be able to change exposure time at fine enough increments.&nbsp; It 
      issues a warning whenever it cannot set the exposure time within 5% of the 
      intended level.&nbsp; There are two realistic alternatives here.&nbsp; One is to 
      set up scheduled changes in exposure time with the <A HREF="hidd_tsvariations.htm">Tilt Series Scheduled Changes Dialog</A>, 
      which will pick exposure times that meet the constraint and angles at which 
      those times should be set.&nbsp; The program would then change intensity between 
      exposure time changes.&nbsp; The second alternative is a hidden workaround to 
      the constraints: set the frame time equal to the exposure time and turn on Dose 
      Fractionation mode without aligning or saving frames.&nbsp; The program will 
      then change exposure time and frame time together in multiples of 2.5 ms.&nbsp; 
      However, acquisition will take longer, 4 sec in counting mode or 5.5 sec in 
      super-resolution.&nbsp; This alternative works only if you have not explicitly 
      scheduled any changes in frame time. </P>
      <P>All camera parameters that are varied during a tilt series are restored to their 
        original values when the series is terminated.</P>
      <P><B>Keep beam intensity constant</B></P>
      <P>Select this option if you do not want the program to change beam intensity or 
        exposure time during the series. Unless you are in low dose mode, the program 
        will actually do nothing to keep the intensity or exposure time constant, and 
        you are free to adjust it yourself.</P>
      <P><B>Vary intensity as 1/cosine of angle to 1/n power</B></P>
      <P>With a power of 1, this option would vary beam intensity or exposure time 
        proportional to the effective thickness of the sample as it tilts. This would 
        probably do a good job only if the fraction of electrons transmitted through 
        the specimen and objective aperture is about 0.5 at zero tilt. With a higher 
        power, the variation in specimen exposure will be less; for example, with a 
        power of two the specimen exposure will vary by the square root of the inverse 
        cosine and thus change by a factor of 1.41 from 0 to 60&deg;</P>
      <P><B>Set intensity to keep mean counts constant</B></P>
      <P>Select this option to have the beam or exposure time continually adjusted during 
        the series so that Record images will have the mean value specified in the text 
        box. Mean counts are measured in the tilt-foreshortened area of an image, i.e., 
        the part that corresponds to what would be visible at zero tilt. The line 
        following this option will report what a Record image would have at the current 
        intensity, based upon the counts in the image in Buffer A.</P>
      <P><B>Taper counts down at high tilt</B></P>
      <P>If you have selected the last option to keep mean counts constant, then this 
        option is available to reduce the target mean value at high tilts. This is 
        useful if the beam cannot be condensed enough to give the desired number of 
        counts without becoming smaller than the camera's field of view at the highest 
        tilts (or, alternatively, if the exposure time cannot be increased above a 
        certain point without getting too much drift in the image). When you select it, 
        you can enter a number of counts in the first text box and an angle in the 
        second box. Enter a positive angle; it will apply on both the positive and 
        negative sides of the tilt series. The target value will change linearly from 
        its standard value at this angle down to the reduced value at the extreme angle 
        of the tilt series.</P>
      <P><B>Keep intensity below current value (use if intensity already set up)</B></P>
      <P>If you are starting at high tilt and have already set up the intensity or 
        exposure time that you want at the starting tilt, use this option instead of 
        specifying tapering of counts. This option will maintain the intensity or 
        exposure time at the maximum amount until the target counts are reached at a 
        lower tilt angle.</P>
      <P><B>Do not increase intensity above value for first saved image</B></P>
      <P>This option can be used to keep the beam from being condensed or the exposure to 
        be increased any more than it was at the beginning of the tilt series. This 
        would be useful if you end up going to higher tilts at the end of the series 
        than at its start, and could also prevent over-condensing the beam during the 
        range of angles where the intensity is tapered. The limiting intensity or 
        exposure time is the value set just after saving the first image of the tilt 
        series and adjusting the beam or exposure time to achieve the target number of 
        counts.</P>
      <P><B>Use current intensity at zero tilt (increase to start series)</B></P>
      <P>This option is relevant and enabled if you have selected inverse cosine 
        intensity changes and are starting at high tilt. Select the option if the 
        intensity or exposure was set up to be appropriate at zero tilt. When the tilt 
        series starts, intensity or exposure will be increased by the appropriate 
        inverse cosine factor.</P>
      <P><B>Dose Estimate</B></P>
      <P>When constant or 1/cosine intensities are selected, information about the total 
        dose will appear, based on the tilt angle range and increment and some of the 
        other settings in this group, and on the current Record parameters and beam 
        settings. If electron dose is calibrated, the line will show the expected dose 
        at zero and high tilt and the total dose in electrons per square Angstrom. If 
        dose is not calibrated, the line will show the dose as a multiple of the dose 
        at zero and at high tilt.</P>
      <P><B>Change other exposures proportional to Record change</B></P>
      <P>This option is available when you have either scheduled changes in Record 
        exposure times or chosen to change exposure time rather than beam intensity. 
        Select it to have the exposure times for all the other camera parameter sets 
        changed whenever the Record exposure is changed, by an amount proportional to 
        the change in Record exposure. Note that if you stop the series, you are free 
        to change these exposure times in the Camera Parameters dialog box, although 
        you may be prevented from changing the record exposure time.</P>
      <P><B>Change drift settling proportional to Record change</B></P>
      <P>Select this option to have drift settling changed proportional to a change in 
        exposure time whenever an exposure time is changed for a camera parameter set. 
        The option is available if all exposures are being changed via the option just 
        above, or if just Record exposure is being changed and there are no scheduled 
        changes in Record drift settling. If there are such scheduled changes, they 
        will control the Record drift settling regardless of whether this option is 
        selected. If you stop the series, you are still free to change the settling 
        times in the Camera Parameters dialog box.</P>
      <H1><A NAME="tss_camera"></A><i><FONT size="3">Camera Selection and Options</FONT></i></H1>
      <P>If you have multiple cameras, each available camera will be listed here so that 
        you can specify or see what camera will be used for the series. The current 
        camera will be the one initially selected. If you select a different camera, it 
        will become the current camera when the series is started.</P>
      <P><B>Average Record dark references</B></P>
      <P>This checkbox is used to specify whether averaging should be used when getting 
        the dark reference for Record images during the tilt series. Its setting 
        overrides the state of the checkbox for averaging Record dark references in the 
        Camera Parameters dialog box, so if you only want the averaging to occur for 
        the one or two dark references used during a tilt series, select this option 
        and leave the option in the Camera Parameters dialog unchecked. The dark 
        reference will be averaged by the number of dark images specified for the 
        Record parameter set in the Camera Parameters dialog.</P>
    <P><b>If taking frames, get initial partial sum of N frames</b></P>
    <P>This option is enabled for a K2/K3 camera and allows an &quot;early return&quot; when either 
      saving frames or aligning frames in the SEMCCD plugin to DM.&nbsp; An image with 
      the sum of the selected number of frames will be returned as soon as those 
      frames are available, and the program is free to go on to other tasks.&nbsp; The 
      initial sum is used for alignment and is also saved to the output file as a 
      placekeeper.&nbsp; The full sum is retrieved just before the next Record image 
      and saved to the file.&nbsp; None of this will occur if there is extra Record 
      output, when montaging, or if any other relevant camera parameters sets have 
      dose-fractionation turned on.</P>
    <P>This option may produce modest time savings if the frame operations are 
      relatively time-consuming, such as by using super-resolution mode, taking many 
      frames, or saving with compression, and if the program needs to do some 
      operations between Record images.&nbsp; There may be no speedup with counting 
      mode images.</P>

        autofocus during the startup of the tilt series will also be skipped.</P>
      <P><B>Do autofocus at certain interval</B></P>
      <P>The Tilt Series Controller will skip autofocusing when the prediction for focus 
        seems reliable enough; however, it will always do an autofocus when the tilt 
        interval since the last time it was done is longer than the value entered in 
        this text box.</P>
      <P><B>Focus every time at high tilt</B></P>
      <P>If this option is selected, the program will do autofocus at every tilt angle 
        above the value entered in the text box. Enter a positive angle; it will apply 
        on both the positive and negative sides of the tilt series.</P>
      <P><B>Check autofocus and stop if inadequate</B></P>
      <P>If this option is selected, the program will run a routine to check the accuracy 
        of autofocus at high tilt, and stop the tilt series if the accuracy is not 
        greater than the specified amount. The routine measures defocus at the current 
        focus, and plus and minus 5 microns from that point, then reports what fraction 
        of the actual change can be measured. If this fraction is less than the amount 
        specified in the text box, then the tilt series is stopped and some 
        recommendations are given for proceeding.</P>
    <P><b>Stop if autofocus exceeds absolute limits</b></P>
    <P>This is one of two options for limiting the focus changes that occur during a 
      tilt series.&nbsp; This option causes autofocus to fail, original focus to be 
      restored, and the tilt series to stop if focus exceeds the absolute limits 
      around eucentric focus that are set with the
      <a href="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_setabsoluteliimits">Set Absolute Limits</a> command in the Focus menu.&nbsp; It is most suitable for preventing 
      focus from being set in a range that would activate the Falcon Dose Protector.&nbsp; 
      It applies to any autofocus done at the start or during the course of the 
      series.</P>
    <P><b>Stop if autofocus change exceeds X microns</b></P>
    <P>This option can be used to protect against large changes in focus, such as when 
      a grid bar or piece of contamination comes into the focusing area.&nbsp; If the 
      focus change imposed by autofocusing would exceed the amount entered in the text 
      box, the autofocus will fail, focus will be restored to its original value, and 
      the tilt series will stop.&nbsp; This option also applies to any autofocus done 
      at the start or during the course of the series.</P>
      <P><i><A NAME="tss_initial_actions"></A><B><FONT size="3">Initial and Final Actions</FONT></B></i></P>
      <P>The options in this group will be enabled as appropriate, depending on whether 
        you are at zero tilt or at the starting tilt of the series.</P>
      <P><B>Buffer A has image of desired area</B></P>
      <P>Select this option if you have left an image in buffer A aligned on the desired 
        area before opening the dialog box. If this option is not selected, the Tilt 
        Series Controller will take its first reference for alignment as soon as 
        possible, but the specimen may have drifted away from the desired position by 
        then. Thus it is generally wise to ensure that there is a good reference before 
        you start. This option is relevant when starting either at zero tilt or at high 
        tilt.</P>
      <P><B>Refine eucentricity</B></P>
      <P>Select this option to have the eucentricity refined before going up to high 
        tilt.</P>
      <P><B>Leave mid-tilt anchor</B></P>
      <P>Select this option to have the 'Walk Up' procedure leave an 'anchor' image near 
        the angle specified in the text box. When the tilt series reaches that angle, 
        the anchor will become the reference for alignment, and this will pull the 
        series into alignment.</P>
      <P><B>Use mid-tilt anchor</B></P>
      <P>Select this option if you have taken an 'anchor' image at an intermediate tilt 
        angle which you want the program to use for alignment when that angle is 
        reached in the tilt series. Use the up or down arrows to select the buffer in 
        which you left the image. If you obtained the anchor with the 'Walk Up &amp; 
        Anchor' command in the Tasks menu, then it will be in the last image buffer, so 
        this buffer is initially the default.</P>
      <P><B>Close column valves at end of series</B></P>
      <P>This option provides the final control of beam intensity by allowing you have 
        the column or gun valves closed at the end of the series. If you open the 
        valves again and take additional pictures one tilt at a time with the One Loop 
        button, they will remain open. On a JEOL without a FEG, this option can be used 
        to turn the filament off instead.</P>
      <P><A NAME="tss_tracking_control"></A><i><B><FONT size="3">Tracking Control Parameters</FONT></B></i></P>
      <P>This grouping contains various parameters that govern the Tilt Series 
        Controller's behavior with regard to predictions for positional and focus 
        changes. The typical user needs to pay attention to just the first three.</P>
      <P><B>Repeat Record if certain percentage of field is lost</B></P>
      <P>With this option selected, the program will repeat the acquisition of a Record 
        image when its error in position is sufficiently high. The error is expressed 
        as the percentage of the field of interest missing from the image. In computing 
        this fraction, the program excludes areas far from the tilt axis that will not 
        be needed for a reconstruction. Thus, at middle to high tilts, the errors in 
        the Y direction (across the tilt axis) can be relatively high without 
        triggering a reshoot. Errors in the X direction (along the tilt axis), or 
        errors in either direction at low tilt, will be constrained to the percentage 
        set in the text box.</P>
      <P>There are several reasons why you might not select this option, or might enter a 
        particularly high value: if you have no interest in what is contained in the 
        periphery of the area being acquired; if you are working at a high 
        magnification where errors are intrinsically higher; or if you are doing low 
        dose work and cannot afford to repeat exposures. In low dose mode, the next 
        option determines what happens if this option is selected.</P>
    <P><b>Stop and ask before repeating Record in Low Dose Mode</b></P>
    <P>With this option and the preceding one selected, the program will stop and ask 
      for confirmation before repeating a Record image in low dose mode. This was the 
      behavior before this checkbox was added.&nbsp; If this option is turned off, the 
      program will retake the image up to three times even in low dose mode.&nbsp; 
      This is useful if you are using low dose mode to get different magnifications 
      for tracking or focusing and the extra exposure of the specimen is not an issue.</P>
      <P><B>Stop when Autoalign gives a large shift</B></P>
      <P>With this option selected, the program will examine all Autoalignments at the 
        regular magnification and will stop the tilt series if the alignment shift 
        exceeds the specified percentage of the size of the image being aligned. This 
        may prevent the program from going astray on a wildly incorrect alignment. When 
        the tilt series stops, you can revert to the previous specimen position by 
        clearing the alignment using the button on the Image Alignment and Focus 
        control panel. If the large image shift is correct, you can resume the tilt 
        series instead.</P>
      <P>Note that when montaging, the image size for this comparison will be that of the 
        Montage Center, i.e., the size of a single frame, not of the whole montage.</P>
      <P><B>Get tracking image when prediction error is high</B></P>
      <P>This entry determines when the program will acquire a tracking image rather than 
        relying on the prediction of the position on the next tilt. The criterion that 
        is entered is expressed as a percentage of the size of the camera area that is 
        being recorded. You may want to enter a larger value when working at high 
        magnifications where errors are inherently larger. On every tilt, the program 
        computes how far the Record image on the previous tilt was from its predicted 
        position in X and in Y. It will choose to do tracking if the prediction error 
        in either the X or the Y direction was greater than the criterion. In addition, 
        it computes a predicted position at the current tilt and the standard error of 
        the prediction in both X and Y. Tracking will occur if the square root of the 
        sum of the squares of these two standard errors is higher than the criterion.</P>
      <P><B>Track: Before - After - Before &amp; after Autofocusing</B></P>
      <P>These radio buttons will control where tracking will occur in the sequence of 
        operations at each tilt. The default is tracking before autofocusing, which 
        will guarantee that focusing is done at the center of the field. However, when 
        drift is bad, the Record image will then be displaced because of the time spent 
        focusing. In this case, selecting tracking after autofocusing will keep the 
        Record image from being off by much. When tracking occurs after autofocusing, 
        SerialEM will adjust the focus as necessary to compensate for the lateral shift 
        in position. If drift is really bad, one could select tracking both before and 
        after focusing.</P>
      <P><B>Stop after aligning tracking image</B></P>
      <P>Selecting this option activates a manual tracking mode in which the program will 
        stop after acquiring and aligning a tracking image. You can then adjust the 
        alignment position manually and resume. When you resume with the One Loop 
        button, the image in buffer A will automatically be taken as a new alignment 
        reference. Thus, in this mode one can simply adjust the tracking position as 
        necessary and push One Loop to go on. When manual tracking is no longer needed, 
        turn off this option.</P>
      <P><B>Align only with tracking images</B></P>
      <P>This option is available in low dose mode, where the program will ordinarily 
        align with tracking images in the Trial area when necessary, and refine the 
        alignment on every tilt with images from the Record area. The alignments 
        occurring in these two separate areas can diverge from each other. If this 
        divergence is too much of a problem, this option can be used to disable 
        alignment of the Record images. It will cause a Trial image to be taken on 
        every tilt and used for tracking.</P>
      <P><B>Align with Preview before getting new track reference</B></P>
      <P>In low dose mode, it is sometimes necessary to take a new tracking reference 
        after a Record image. If there is drift and time for acquiring the Record image 
        is long, this reference will be in the wrong place. With this option selected, 
        the program will always take a Preview image and align it to the existing 
        Record reference just before acquiring a new tracking reference. Since the 
        Preview should take less time to acquire, the track reference location will be 
        more accurate. This presumes that Preview is set up to take a fast, binned 
        image that will not contribute much to the dose on the Record area.</P>
      <P><B>Get new track reference if Record alignment differs</B></P>
      <P>The criterion entered in this text box comes into play both in low dose mode and 
        when low magnification tracking is enabled. In both of these cases, it is 
        possible for the alignment specified by the tracking images to diverge from the 
        alignment of the Record images. When the program takes a tracking image and 
        uses it for alignment, then finds that the position of the next Record image is 
        in error by more than this criterion, it will take a tracking image after the 
        Record on the next tilt and use this image as a new reference. This criterion 
        should be set rather high, because minor misalignments are handled 
        automatically by simply shifting the existing reference.</P>
      <P><B>Repeat autofocus if error is high</B></P>
      <P>When this option is selected, the program will repeat the autofocus procedure 
        when the defocus measured by a first autofocus differs from the predicted value 
        by more than the criterion entered in the text box. It does this even if the 
        prediction had a high standard error and was likely to be in error itself.</P>
      <P><B>Do autofocus when prediction error is high</B></P>
      <P>This entry determines when the program will autofocus rather than relying on the 
        prediction of the focus on the next tilt. This criterion is compared with two 
        different errors. At every tilt, the program computes a predicted defocus and a 
        standard error for this prediction. Autofocus will be done if twice this 
        standard error is greater than the criterion. In addition, if autofocus was 
        done at the previous tilt, there is an actual error, the difference between the 
        measured defocus and the predicted value. Autofocus will be done if this actual 
        error exceeded the criterion.</P>

    series acquisition from TEM mode.</P>
      <p><i>Shift/Centering Options and Interset Shifts.</i>&nbsp; Options to control beam 
        centering and energy filter alignment are disabled.&nbsp; In this section, a 
        line is added to report whether image shifts exist to keep Trial and Focus 
        images centered on the Record images.&nbsp; These shifts can be calibrated 
        quickly before a tilt series, once the exposure times have been finalized.&nbsp; 
        See <A HREF="menu_tasks.htm#hid_tasks_assess_interset_shifts">Assess Interset Shifts</A>
        for details.</p>
      <p><i>Exposure Time Changes Only.</i>&nbsp; It is not possible to change beam intensity 
        continuously in STEM mode, so the Beam Intensity Control section allows changes 
        only in exposure time.&nbsp; Moreover, image counts do not scale with exposure, 
        so options for maintaining a constant number of counts are disabled.&nbsp; This 
        just leaves the option for changing exposure as a function of the cosine of the 
        tilt angle.&nbsp; There are two situations where this would not be appropriate.&nbsp; 
        First, dark field signals may become stronger with increased sample thickness 
        rather than weaker.&nbsp; Second, if you are using dynamic focusing with FEI 
        STEM, you may need to use a discrete set of Record exposure times where the 
        flyback time has been calibrated (see <A href="menu_calibration.htm#hid_calibration_quick_flyback_time">
    Quick Flyback Time</A>), rather than allowing exposure time to vary 
        continuously.&nbsp; The solution is to check 'Change some settings as a function 
        of angle', press Set Changes, and enter the needed exposures in the
         <A HREF="hidd_tsvariations.htm">
          Tilt Series Scheduled Changes dialog box</A>.</p>

          disabled.</P>
    <P><i>Separate Parameters</i>.&nbsp; For several parameters, separate values are 
      maintained for TEM and nanoprobe STEM mode, and microprobe STEM mode (if 
      present), and stored in your settings file.&nbsp; These parameters are the tilt 
      series magnification, the magnification for low mag tracking, and the maximum 
      focus prediction error allowed before autofocusing is needed.&nbsp; The latter 
      is maintained separately because STEM imaging in nanoprobe mode probably 
      requires a tighter tolerance on focus than TEM imaging.</P>
