    <P>This dialog box allows you to acquire a gain reference for the current camera. 
      References are needed for Tietz and AMT cameras and are optional for Eagle and 
      Gatan cameras (except K2 and OneView, where they cannot be taken). This reference is separate from the gain reference that 
      DigitalMicrograph maintains, and once a reference has been obtained through 
      SerialEM, SerialEM will use this reference instead of DigitalMicrograph's 
      reference. There are two advantages to using a SerialEM gain reference:</P>
    <P>1)If SerialEM's capability for removing X-rays from dark references is 
      configured, the gain reference will be protected from the effects of X-rays in 
      its dark reference (which produce hot pixels in the gain reference.)</P>
    <P>2)If you have a 4K camera with a slow readout and only need to use it as a 2K 
      camera (e.g., fiber optic camera at 300 KV), SerialEM allows you take just a 
      gain reference binned by 2, which is much faster than taking a reference in 
      DigitalMicrograph.</P>
    <P>Normalization is always done in DM for images from a K2 camera because of the 
      complexity of the processing there.&nbsp; For a OneView camera, drift correction 
      can be done only with normalization within DM, so there seems to be no point in 
      having a separate reference within SerialEM for images where drift correction is 
      not needed.</P>
    <P>To acquire a gain reference, you want to have a fairly bright, uniform beam with 
      no specimen. The beam should be spread larger than the field of the camera, and 
      will be more uniform if it is spread as large as the whole viewing screen. A 
      dimmer beam may be appropriate for binnigs higher than 2. Check the following 
      parameters and press YES to proceed.</P>
    <P><B>Target number of counts</B></P>
    <P>SerialEM will find the exposure time that will give this number of counts in 
      each image that it takes. Enter a value in the text box or use the spin buttons 
      to change the value by 500 . A high value (e.g. 8000) is generally appropriate 
      for a sensitive camera, even if you are going to take low-dose images. However, 
      if the camera is less sensitive, it may be necessary to make the target about 
      the same as the number of counts expected in a typical image with normal 
      exposure.</P>
    <P><B>Number of frames to average</B></P>
    <P>Use this entry to set the number of images to acquire and average. Five to ten 
      frames will usually give good results; the higher number may be needed to 
      average out X-rays more.</P>
    <P><B>Reference Binning</B></P>
    <P>Select 1 to make an unbinned gain reference, which can be used to normalize 
      images with any binning but could take a long time to acquire; or 2 to make a 
      gain reference binned by 2. The latter can be used only to normalize images 
      with even binnings. The text on this radio button will say whether an image 
      with odd binning will be normalized with an older unbinned reference from 
      SerialEM or with a reference from DigitalMicrograph. If your properties file 
      contains an entry for 'ExtraGainReferences', you will also see choices for up 
      to four higher binnings. Note that the target number of counts will change by a 
      factor of 4 when you switch between unbinned and binned gain references, but 
      the target does not change when switching between different binned references.</P>
    <P><B>Average dark reference</B></P>
    <P>Select this option to have the dark reference used for the gain reference images 
      averaged by the number of times indicated in the text box. This averaging will 
      reduce the effects of X-rays in the dark reference if you do not have X-ray 
      removal set up or if it is not working well with the particular kind of X-ray 
      signals produced in the camera.</P>
    <P><B>Calibrate dose with last image</B></P>
    <P>If this option is selected, then for an unbinned or binned by 2 reference, the 
      program will use the last reference image to calibrate electron dose for the 
      current spot size (see <A HREF="menu_calibration.htm#hid_calibration_electrondose">Electron 
        Dose Calibration</A> ). On an FEI scope, the spot size will be normalized 
      after you press the Yes button, in order for this to be as accurate as 
      possible. This may change the beam position and brightness, so there will then 
      be a message box reminding you to check the size and centering of the beam. On 
      some scopes, this is not necessary, and there is a property that can be set to 
      suppress the message. Otherwise, if the message is too annoying and you really 
      do not care about dose, then deselect this option.</P>
    <P><b>Autosave raw frames</b></P>
    <P>This option is available for Direct Electron cameras; when selected, raw frames 
      will be&nbsp; saved by the server for each gain reference image that is taken. </P>
