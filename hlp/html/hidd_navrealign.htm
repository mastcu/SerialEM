        Dialog</span></p>
    <p> This dialog allows parameters to be set for the Align to Template task, which 
      can be run either from a script command or from the Navigator during the Acquire 
      at Items procedure.&nbsp; A subset of these parameters govern whether image 
      shift is reset after an alignment and are also used for the Realign to Item 
      operation when it is run from Acquire at Items.</p>
    <p> A template is an image of some generic feature, like a hole in the carbon 
      film, to which other images can be aligned.&nbsp; Aligning to a template 
      requires specifying two things: where the image is, and how to acquire an image 
      for aligning to it.&nbsp; Both pieces of information are provided by specifying 
      a Navigator map image to use as the template.&nbsp; Typically a template will be 
      a small image, and the image to be aligned would be much larger.&nbsp; To allow 
      for this, a template map can be created with a special feature: the Navigator 
      values for the map size indicate the size of the image to acquire rather than 
      the size of the image itself.&nbsp; This is possible within SerialEM by cropping 
      the template from a larger image.&nbsp; The program keeps track of the original 
      size of the image, or montage piece, from which an image is cropped, and assigns 
      this to the map size values when the image is made into a map.&nbsp; This 
      original, uncropped size is also stored in an &#39;.mdoc&#39; metadata file along with 
      the other information about the acquisition conditions, so it is possible to 
      reopen a file (even one from another session), reread the image, and make it a 
      template map.</p>
    <p> If you want to align to the template with images smaller than the typical 
      full-field ones, you can acquire an image of whatever size you prefer and crop 
      the template from that.&nbsp; However, this should not be necessary if you 
      specify an appropriate maximum distance for the alignment shift.</p>
    <p> <strong><em>Parameters for Aligning to a Template</em></strong></p>
    <p> <strong>Label of Navigator map with template</strong></p>
    <p> The map to use is found by its label.&nbsp; Enter either the label of an 
      existing map, or the label you want to assign if you are going to make a map 
      from a cropped image in buffer A.&nbsp; The label should be unique.&nbsp; The 
      line below will indicate whether the item does not yet exist, whether an item 
      withat label is not a map, or whether it is a montage map, which is not allowed.&nbsp; 
      The tests for whether the label exists are case-insensitive.</p>
    <p> <strong>Make Map from Image in A</strong></p>
    <p> This button is enabled if there is a cropped image in buffer A that has not 
      been made a map yet (has no map ID value).&nbsp; Press this button to make it a 
      map.&nbsp; If it is not saved to file yet, the browser for specifying a file 
      name will open.&nbsp; The program will make a map and close the file if it 
      opened one.&nbsp; Then a dialog will open with a text box for setting the label 
      of the map.&nbsp; If you already had an entry in the <strong>Label</strong> text 
      box above and there was not already an item with that label, it will offer that 
      label.&nbsp; Otherwise it will offer the automatically assigned label, which you 
      are free to change, as long as what you enter is not the label of an existing 
      item.</p>
    <p> <strong>Maximum alignment shift</strong></p>
    <p> Enter the maximum shift in microns that will be allowed in the alignment to 
      the template.&nbsp; This should be less than half the <em>center-to-center</em> distance between adjacent 
      features, to prevent the program from aligning on a feature farther from center 
      than the likely target.</p>
    <p> <strong><em>Parameters for Handling Image Shift after Alignment</em></strong></p>
    <p> Both Align to Template and Realign to Item have the ability to finish by 
      resetting image shift if it is above a threshold, moving the stage to 
      compensate, and restoring the alignment with a new image.&nbsp; As the verbose 
      lines in this section of the dialog indicate, the settings specified here are 
      applied for both procedures: when running Align to Template from Acquire at 
      Points, as defaults when running the AlignToTemplate script command, and when 
      running Realign to Item from Acquire at points.</p>
    <p> <strong>Reset image shift and realign if &gt; D microns</strong></p>
    <p> Check the option to enable restting of image shift, and fill in the text box 
      with a threshold in microns above which it will be reset after aligning to the 
      template.&nbsp; The realignment is done by aligning a new image to the 
      previously acquired image, not to the template.</p>
    <p> <strong>Reset IS up to N times</strong></p>
    <p> Set the spinner to the maximum number of image shift resets to do.&nbsp; If 
      image shift is still above the threshold after one reset shift and realign, the 
      program will do another iteration, up to this limit.</p>
    <p> <strong>Leave IS at 0 (skip last realign)</strong></p>
    <p> Select this option to leave image shift at zero and thus leave a little 
      misalignment in the image.&nbsp; This is accomplished by doing a final image 
      shift reset when the image shift is below threshold (which might occur right 
      after alignment to the template), and not realigning with another image.&nbsp; 
      This final reset counts towards the maximum.&nbsp; If the maximum is 1, it will 
      simply reset the image shift after aligning to the template, and not acquire 
      another image.</p>
