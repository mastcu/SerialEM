    <P>This dialog box allows you to specify exposure parameters for image 
      acquisition. The controls for a CCD camera are described first.&nbsp; Options 
      specific to the Gatan K2 Summit camera are described in <A HREF="#K2controls">
      Controls for Gatan K2 Camera</A>, one for Direct Electron direct detector 
      cameras in <a href="#DEcontrols">Controls for Direct Electron Cameras</a>, and 
      ones for Falcon cameras in <a href="#FalconControls">Controls for FEI Falcon 
      Camera</a>. Controls for STEM acquisition, and modifications of the existing 
      controls, are described in
      <A HREF="#STEMcontrols">Controls in STEM Mode.</A>
    </P>
    <P><B>Camera radio buttons</B></P>
    <P>If you have multiple cameras, each available camera will be listed here. Each 
      camera has an independent set of parameters. The current camera will be the one 
      selected. If you select a different camera, that one will become the current 
      camera when you press OK in this dialog, but not if you press Cancel.</P>
    <P><B>Match pixel size and/or intensity when changing camera</B></P>
    <P>These buttons will appear if you have two or more CCD cameras that are not on a 
      GIF. If you select pixel matching, the program will change magnification if 
      necessary so that the pixel size matches as well as possible when you change 
      from one camera to another. If you select intensity matching, then beam 
      intensity will be adjusted so that the electrons per pixel per second will be 
      the same after switchin between cameras. The pixel matching can be controlled by 
      setting a property 'PixelMatchFactor' for one or more cameras; for example, 
      setting this factor to 2 for one camera will make it match binned pixels for 
      that camera with unbinned pixels for the other camera. This factor also adjusts 
      the effective pixel size for intensity matching as well.</P>
    <P><B>Parameter set radio buttons</B></P>
    <P>There are five independent parameter sets for taking pictures. Use these 
      buttons to select a set and view and adjust its parameters. Whenever you change 
      from one set to another, the parameters are stored for the set that you are 
      leaving.</P>
    <P><B>Copy from other camera</B></P>
    <P>This button is available if there are multiple cameras. Press it to copy 
      parameters for the current parameter set from the camera listed on the button. 
      Acquisition area will be scaled appropriately if the two cameras are different 
      sizes.</P>
    <P><B>Acquisition</B></P>
    <P>These buttons determine whether a single image will be acquired or whether 
      acquisition will repeat automatically. Continuous acquisition is relatively slow 
      in SerialEM for some cameras, but for newer Gatan cameras it accesses continuous 
      camera modes and is fast. If you start a continuous acquisition, you can stop it 
      by pressing the space bar or Esc up pushing the STOP button, and you can restart 
      it by pressing the space bar again.&nbsp; Most automated operations (i.e., tasks 
      and tilt series) will use single-image mode even when taking an image with a parameter set in which 
      you selected continuous mode.&nbsp; Thus, you should be able to use those 
      operations without having to turn off continuous mode in any of your parameter 
      sets.</P>
    <P><B>Processing</B></P>
    <P>These buttons determine whether you will acquire an unprocessed, raw image from 
      the camera, an image with the dark reference subtracted, or a gain-normalized 
      image. An image is gain-normalized by subtracting a dark reference then dividing 
      by the gain reference.</P>
    <P><B>Remove X-rays</B></P>
    <P>This checkbox will activate removal of X-rays from an image taken with this 
      parameter set. It will appear only if the ShowRemoveXRaysBox property is set for 
      the particular camera, or if one of your parameter sets already has the option 
      checked. Use this option only if necessary to prevent bad tracking due to large 
      X-rays, since the X-ray removal in SerialEM is not as effective or reliable as 
      the removal with Ccderaser in IMOD. The parameters controlling the X ray removal 
      are adjusted through the <A HREF="menu_process.htm#hid_process_setimagecriteria">
        Set Image Criteria command</A> in the Processing menu.</P>
    <P><b>Correct Drift</b></P>
    <P>This checkbox is present for a OneView camera and turns on the real-time drift 
      correction by that camera.</P>
    <P><B>Binning</B></P>
    <P>These radio buttons present the options for binning an image directly as it is 
      read out of the CCD camera.</P>
    <P><B>Exposure time</B></P>
    <P>This text box allows you to enter the exposure time in seconds. Unlike in DM, 
      exposure time will not change when you change binning.</P>
    <P><B>Drift settling</B></P>
    <P>This text box allows you to enter the amount of time that the specimen will be 
      exposed to the beam before the picture begins being recorded on the CCD camera. 
      This will minimize the effects of image drift when the beam first hits the 
      specimen.&nbsp; For a OneView camera, drift settling is achieved by throwing 
      away initial camera frames andit thus works with one shutter connected.&nbsp; 
      However, if there are two shutters connected, the settling works only when the 
      &#39;Film shutter&#39; option described next is selected, so the box is disabled and the 
      settling value there will have no effect if the &#39;Beam shutter&#39; option is 
      selected.</P>
    <P><B>Shutter mode</B></P>
    <P>These radio buttons allow a choice of how shutters will be operated to expose 
      the specimen and camera. The first two options correspond to the two shuttering 
      modes available in DM when there are two shutters:</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        Beam blanking only uses the shutter above the specimen; the beam is on the 
        specimen only during the exposure time, unless drift settling is non-zero.</LI>
      <LI>
        Film shutter with beam blanking uses a combination of shutters below and above 
        the specimen. If drift settling is zero, the specimen is exposed for a fixed 
        amount before image acquisition for a CCD camera, while the CCD is cleared. The 'Minimum time if 
        not 0.0' listed below the drift settling box is based on this clearing time. 
        Unfortunately, the specimen is also exposed throughout the readout of the 
        camera.</LI>
      <LI>
        Dual shuttering for minimum exposure is accomplished by SerialEM using the beam 
        blanker above the specimen to eliminate the unwanted exposure in DM's film 
        shutter option. (This blanker is separate from the beam shutter that DM uses.) 
        SerialEM can thus provide a full range of drift settling times, both longer and 
        shorter than the clearing time, without the undesirable effects that occur with 
        drift settling through DM. Exposure is also eliminated during camera readout. 
        When drift settling is zero, SerialEM simply uses DM's beam shutter mode. As 
        long as this shuttering mode is working reliably, there is no reason not to have 
        it selected for all parameter sets.</LI></OL>
    <P>For a Tietz camera, only two shutter modes are shown. In the first mode, the 
      specimen will be exposed only during the drift settling time, if this is 
      possible, plus the exposure time. In the second mode, the beam will be left on 
      the specimen continuously.</P>
    <P><B>Force new dark reference next time only</B></P>
    <P>If this option is selected, SerialEM will take a new dark reference itself, or 
      force DM to take a new dark reference, the next time a picture is taken with 
      this parameter set, and then the option will be cleared.&nbsp; There is no 
      control over dark references with a K2 or OneView camera.</P>
    <P><B>Take new dark reference each time</B></P>
    <P>If this option is selected, SerialEM will take a new dark reference itself, or 
      force DM to take a new dark reference, each time a picture is taken with this 
      parameter set, which should be unnecessary unless DM's drift settling is used in 
      an older version of DM.</P>
    <P><B>Average dark reference</B></P>
    <P>If this option is selected, then the dark reference will be averaged the number 
      of times indicated in the text box. Averaging can be helpful for low-exposure 
      images if the camera readout is particularly noisy. This selection, like 
      everything else on the dialog, is specific to the camera and parameter set. 
      Checking this box does not affect when a dark reference is taken; if you change 
      the setting, use 'Force new dark reference next time' to get a new dark 
      reference. When an averaged dark reference is taken, the status bar will display 
      'Dark Ref #n' instead of 'Getting Dark Reference. If you press 'Stop' before the 
      dark reference is finished, a dark reference will be saved based on the average 
      of the references already obtained, and will be used on the next acquisition.</P>
    <P><B>Top - Left - Bottom - Right</B></P>
    <P>These text boxes display and allow you to change the coordinates of the area to 
      be acquired. As in DM, Y coordinates start with zero at the top. Unlike in DM, 
      coordinates are always expressed in terms of the full, unbinned size of the CCD 
      camera.</P>
    <P><B>Up-down and Left-right Spin Buttons and Recenter Button</B></P>
    <P>The two pairs of spin buttons allow you to shift the capture area in any 
      desired direction without changing its size. The Recenter button will undo these 
      shifts and center the area on the camera.</P>
    <P><B>Swap X &amp; Y</B></P>
    <P>This button will transpose the X and Y coordinates to the extent possible. Even 
      on a square camera, the X and Y sizes may not exchange exactly because of 
      different constraints on sizes in the two directions.</P>
    <P><B>Quarter - Half - Full - Wide Quarter - Wide Half</B></P>
    <P>These buttons provide the most convenient way to select the area of the camera 
      to be acquired. The quarter and half buttons refer to linear dimensions. The 
      wide quarter is one quarter of the height and one-half of the width of the 
      camera, while the wide half is one half the height and the full width of the 
      camera. These options are provided because camera readout time is dominated by 
      the number of rows being read out, and a rectangle gives more pixels of data per 
      unit time than a square.</P>
    <P><B>10% Less - 10% More - A Bit Less or Square</B></P>
    <P>These buttons provide a convenient way to adjust the area being acquired to 
      sizes other than the stock ones provided by the buttons above. Again, the 
      changes are in linear dimensions, not areas. Because of rounding, the '10% Less' 
      button will not exactly undo the change made by the '10% More' button, and vice 
      versa. To get back to a regular size, just push one of the upper buttons.</P>
    <P>The 'A Bit Less' button was useful for creating parameter sets with a slightly 
      different sizes so that they would have independent dark references in DM. For 
      older versions of DM, if you had two parameter sets with the same image size and 
      binning but different exposures, DM would take a new dark reference every time 
      you switched from one to the other. Making one set 'a bit less' in size would 
      prevent this. However, as of at least DM version 3.8, DM would keep only one 
      reference per binning regardless of size, making this trick ineffective. For a 
      camera that is not within 10% of being square, this button is converted to 
      'Square', which will make a square area by trimming the current size in its long 
      dimension to match the short dimension.</P>
    <P><B>Dose readout and Update Dose button</B></P>
    <P>If electron dose is calibrated for the current spot size and intensity, the 
      estimated dose will be shown for the given exposure. This readout is refreshed 
      whenever you change parameter sets or when you press the Update Dose button, so 
      you can change brightness and use this button to see the effect of the change.&nbsp; 
      For a direct detector camera, there is also a line expressing the dose rate as electrons per 
      unbinned pixel per second, which is the value that affects camera performance.&nbsp; 
      Initially, this will be a dose rate incident on the specimen; but once an image is taken with 
      the camera, the program estimates the dose rate at the camera based on the apparent attenuation
      in the dose rate from specimen to camera in the last image that was taken.
      </P>
    <P><B>OK - Acquire - Cancel</B></P>
    <P>When you press the OK button, any changes in the current parameter set will be 
      saved; if you press Cancel, such changes will be discarded. Note that changes 
      are saved for a parameter set whenever you switch to another set. If you press 
      Acquire, the dialog will go away, an image of the current type will be taken, 
      the <A HREF="menu_process.htm#hid_process_minmaxmean">Min/Max/Mean command</A> 
      of the Process menu will be run, and the dialog will reappear.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><i><A NAME="K2controls"></A><B><FONT size="3">Controls for Gatan K2 Camera</FONT></B></i></P>
    <P>When a K2 camera is selected, the bottom section of this dialog provides 
      options for accessing the special features of this camera.&nbsp; Some general 
      features of the camera images and of SerialEM&#39;s interface to this camera are 
      explained in <A href="about_camera.htm#directDetectors">Direct Electron Detectors,
       Especially the Gatan K2</A>.  The most salient points are these:</P>
    <ul>
      <li>Binning values are relative to the native 3.8K x 3.7K pixels of the camera; a 7.6K x 7.4K image in 
        super-resolution mode is referred to as having binning 0.5. </li>
      <li>SerialEM or its plugin to DM can apply anti-aliased image reduction to an unbinned 
        image received from DM to produce an image with the binning that you select.&nbsp; 
        This method is used automatically for binned images in super-resolution or 
        dose-fractionation mode, and there is an option at the bottom of the dialog to 
        apply it for all binned images.&nbsp; To the right of that checkbox is a bold 
        indicator for whether binning or anti-aliasing is being used.</li>
      <li>The dose rate estimate shown here can be useful for anticipating whether 
        electron counting can be used effectively, but it is the dose rate incident on 
        the sample, estimated from the current beam settings.&nbsp; The dose rate at the 
        camera will be less and is known only after an image is taken.</li>
      <li>In Dose Fractionation mode, the image is constrained to be full-sized and 
        subarea options are disabled.</li>
      <li>There are several constraints on exposure time, drift settling, or frame time 
        that are enforced whenever you change one of these entries, so it is best to tab 
        out of a field after changing it, to see whether it gets changed to something 
        unexpected. 
      <li>Unprocessed or dark-subtracted data (which are the same) can be saved in less space and gain-normalized later.&nbsp; 
        When saving such frames, the frame sum returned to SerialEM will be 
        gain-normalized even though normalization is not selected.</ul>
    <P><b>Linear - Counting - Super-resolution Mode</b></P>
    <P>These radio buttons allow one to select one of the basic camera modes.&nbsp; 
      The image size and binning selection are preserved when switching into 
      super-resolution mode, or when switching out of it if the binning is above 0.5.</P>
    <P><b>Always reduce to &quot;Binned size&quot; with anti-aliasing instead of binning</b></P>
    <P>Select this option to have anti-aliasing applied to binned images in counting 
      and linear modes as well as in super-resolution mode.</P>
    <P><b>Dose Fractionation Mode</b></P>
    <P>Use this checkbox to select Dose Fractionation mode, which enables a number of 
      other options.</P>
    <P><b>Frame Time</b></P>
    <P>Enter the exposure time of each frame of the exposure in Dose Fractionation 
      mode.&nbsp; The frame time is constrained to a minimum of 0.025 second.</P>
    <P><b>Align Frames</b></P>
    <P>Select this checkbox to have frames aligned in one of two ways (in DM, or by the 
      SerialEM plugin to DM), or to have the plugin write a command file for aligning 
      with the Alignframes program in IMOD.&nbsp; Press the <b>
      Set Up</b> button to open the <a href="hidd_framealign.htm">Frame Alignment 
      Parameters dialog</a> and choose the method and parameters for aligning. When 
      frame alignment is selected, an indicator below this checkbox will show which 
      method is selected: &#39;Align in DM&#39;, &#39;Align in Plugin&#39;, and either &#39;Align in IMOD&#39; 
      or &#39;TS only in IMOD&#39; when the third method is chosen.&nbsp; In the 
      latter two cases, frame saving will be activated automatically; the &#39;Save 
      Frames&#39; checkbox will be disabled and shown as checked.&nbsp; When frame 
      alignment is turned off or the option to align with IMOD is no longer selected, 
      the &#39;Save Frames&#39; checkbox will revert to its original setting.</P>
    <P><b>Save Frames</b></P>
    <P>Select this checkbox to have SerialEM's plugin to DM save each frame to 
      disk.&nbsp; See above.</P>
    <P><b>Set File Options</b></P>
    <P>Press this button to open the <a href="hidd_k2_save_options.htm">Frame File 
      Options dialog</a> and make choices for whether to save frames 
      in MRC or compressed TIFF format, whether to save frames in a stack or in 
      separate files, whether to acquire frames without software gain normalization 
      regardless of the processing option selected here, and whether to pack data acquired without 
      normalization into half the space.&nbsp; The dialog also allows 
      you to control the names of these files and to put subsets of them into 
      different folders automatically.&nbsp; The choices set in the dialog are summarized in 
      a line just above this button when saving is turned on. That line also shows the 
      number of frames to be saved and whether they will be raw or normalized.&nbsp; </P>
    <P><b>Set Folder</b></P>
    <P>Press this button to select the directory where subframes will be saved as a 
      stack, or where a container directory will be created for saving subframes in 
      single files.&nbsp; If the SerialEM is running on the K2 computer, a directory 
      browser will open.&nbsp; Otherwise, a small dialog will appear with a text box in which 
      any directory name may be typed, even one not accessible to the computer running 
      SerialEM.&nbsp; The dialog may also have a 'Browse' button that will open the directory 
      browser.&nbsp; This browser is able to select only a valid existing directory in 
      file systems accessible from the local computer, but it allows you to create a 
      directory.&nbsp; The plugin is able to create a directory, but only if its 
      parent already exists.&nbsp; This means that if you do not specify the use of 
      folder names in the&nbsp; <a href="hidd_k2_save_options.htm">Frame File 
      Options dialog</a>, you can specify a folder here that does not exist, as long 
      as its parent directory exists. However, if you do select options for automatic 
      folder creation in that dialog, the directory you select here does need to exist before image acquisition. 
      In this situation,&nbsp;if you enter into the text box a 
      new directory that is accessible only from a separate computer hosting the K2, 
      be sure to create this directory before trying to acquire.</P>
    <P><b>Save variable frame sums</b></P>
    <P>Select this option to save sums of camera frames of variable size, e.g., single 
      camera frames 
      at the beginning of the exposure, then pairs of camera frames, then larger sums at the 
      end.&nbsp; The first time that you turn this option on, the
      <a href="#hidd_falcon_frames">Frame Summing Selector dialog</a> will open to 
      allow you to specify the variable summing of frames.&nbsp; Thereafter, this 
      dialog can be opened with the <b>Set Up</b> button.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><i><A NAME="DEcontrols"></A><B><FONT size="3">Controls for Direct Electron Cameras</FONT></B></i></P>
    <P>When a Direct Electron direct detector or its survey sensor is selected, a 
      section at the bottom opens up to allow control of what frames are saved by the 
      Direct Electron server.&nbsp; The choices are to save <b>Raw frames</b>, images 
      that are sums of a specified number of successive frames (<b>Sum images with 
      frame count</b>), or the final summed image (<b>Final image</b>).&nbsp; All of 
      these images are unprocessed and require dark-subtraction and gain normalization 
      to be useful.&nbsp; The server will save some appropriate dark and gain images 
      at various times in the autosave directory.</P>
    <P>The summed image option does not produce useful output with the version 
      of the server available in October 2013 but will be supported by a later 
      version.</P>
    <P><b>Set File Suffix</b></P>
    <P>Press this button to open the <a href="hidd_k2_save_options.htm">Frame File 
      Options dialog</a>, which allows you add a suffix to the frame filenames based 
      on your selection of components, such as SerialEM output filename or tilt angle.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><i><A NAME="FalconControls"></A><B><FONT size="3">Controls for FEI Falcon Camera</FONT></B></i></P>
    <P>When a Falcon camera is selected and the SerialEM property file contains an 
      entry for the configuration file that FEI uses to specify intermediate frame-saving from the 
      camera, a section at the bottom opens to allow control of frame-saving.&nbsp; 
      With frame-saving selected, the FEI software writes the intermediate frames to a 
      location specified in that file.&nbsp; SerialEM reads those files, converts them 
      to a single MRC stack, and deletes the original frame files.&nbsp; Although the 
      number of frames that can be saved is currently quite limited, it is possible to 
      use script commands to take multiple exposures whose frames are stacked into a 
      single MRC file.</P>
    <P><b>Intermediate frame-saving is ON in FEI dialog</b></P>
    <P>Frame-saving is enabled by a separate dialog that SerialEM cannot communicate 
      with; however, there is another Falcon configuration file that SerialEM can 
      check to determine whether it is enabled, and on some systems, modifying this 
      file will enable it. There are thus 3 cases:</P>
    <ol>
      <li>SerialEM does not succeed in getting the camera mode from this file: A check box 
        appears here with this label; it must be turned on when the frame-saving is enabled in 
      the FEI dialog, and turned off when it is disabled there.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>SerialEM can track whether frame-saving is enabled but not enable/disable it: 
        A text line appears here to indicate whether the frame-saving is ON or OFF, but 
        it must be controlled from the FEI dialog.</li>
      <li>SerialEM can enable or disable frame-saving by changing the Falcon 
        configuration file: no text appears here.&nbsp; The program will enable or 
        disable frame-saving as needed for each individual shot, and restore the state 
        selected in the FEI dialog after each shot if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      None of the other options in this section are enabled unless SerialEM thinks 
      that frame saving is either enabled or can be enabled when needed.&nbsp; Once 
      frame-saving is enabled in scenario 1 or 2 above, the intermediate frame 
      configuration file will be managed for every image acquisition, either to 
      specify what frames to save or to prevent the saving of any frames.&nbsp; In 
      scenario 3, either the Falcon configuration file or the intermediate frame file, 
      or both, are always managed on every acquisition. Also, when the frame-saving is 
      enabled, images will be gain-normalized 
      in FEI software instead of in SerialEM, since problems have been seen in images 
      gain-normalized in SerialEM when frame-saving is enabled.</p>
    <P><b>Set Up Frames to Save</b></P>
    <P>Press this button to open the <a href="#hidd_falcon_frames">Frame Summing Selector dialog</a>, which allows you to set how many frames are to be saved 
      from an exposure, as well as whether to skip some portion of camera readouts at 
      the beginning and end of the exposure.&nbsp; This dialog will open automatically 
      when frame-saving is selected for a parameter set that has no previous 
      information about how to save frames.&nbsp; Once this information is set up, it 
      may not be necessary to access this dialog often.&nbsp; When exposure time is

    <P><i><A NAME="STEMcontrols"></A><B><FONT size="3">Controls in STEM Mode</FONT></B></i></P>

    <p>
      In STEM mode, there are some new controls, while other controls are omitted or 
      disabled.&nbsp; The Processing and Shutter Mode radio buttons, and items related 
      to dark references and dose are omitted.&nbsp; Positioning controls are 
      disabled.&nbsp; Only the <b>Quarter</b>, <b>Half</b>, and <b>Full</b> area size 
      buttons are shown, and they are disabled for DigiScan.&nbsp; Other new controls, 
      or ones with changed meaning, are as follows:</p>
    <p>
      <b>Continuous Acquisition</b></p>
    <p>
      With DigiScan, selecting <b>Continuous</b> acquisition starts a continuous scan, 
      which SerialEM periodically reads.&nbsp; Although DigiScan stops the scan 
      whenever the image is being read out, this mode still presents an advantage 
      because SerialEM can process an image (e.g., for Live FFT) during the next scan.&nbsp; 
      For FEI STEM, <b>Continuous</b> just acquires single frames one after another, 
      the same as for as CCD camera.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Binning</b></p>
    <p>
      IIn STEM, 'binning' decreases the number of pixels acquired on each line and the 
      number of lines of data.&nbsp; If total exposure time is kept the same, the 
      pixel dwell time is increased by the square of the change in binning, so there 
      is an increase in signal-to-noise ratio comparable to that achieved by binning 
      on a CCD camera.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Mag for Autofocusing</b></p>
    <p>
      These control appear for the Focus parameter set with DigiScan and allow one to 
      change the magnification used for autofocusing.&nbsp; The primary purpose for 
      this is to compensate for the inability to acquire subareas with DigiScan; thus 
      one can choose to increase magnification by 2, 3, or 4 times.&nbsp; In addition, 
      one can reduce magnification by a factor of 2; this would be useful, and more 
      convenient than using Low Dose mode, if autofocusing needs a larger field of 
      view to work reliably while tracking does not.&nbsp; In any case, the nearest 
      available magnification is chosen for the Focus pictures.&nbsp; To see what the 
      Focus pictures look like, check b&gt;Do for all Focus shots.</b></p>
    <p>
      <b>Exposure time and Pixel time</b></p>
    <p>
      The duration of the exposure can be controlled by entering a number in either 
      the <b>Exposure time</b> text box (in seconds) or the <b>Pixel time</b> text box 
      (in microseconds).&nbsp; Entering a number in either box will change the value 
      in the other box.&nbsp; There is only one underlying value that controls the 
      acquisition, the pixel dwell time.&nbsp; The exposure time is defined as the 
      product of the time per pixel and the number of pixels; the actual acquisition 
      time will be greater because of time spent between lines of the scan.&nbsp; When 
      a new exposure time is entered, it may be modified slightly because of 
      constraints on the pixel time, or more extensively if <b>Line Sync</b> is 
      checked with DigiScan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Keep pixel time when binning changes</b></p>
    <p>
      Ordinarily, the exposure time is kept the same when binning changes, and thus 
      the pixel time changes.&nbsp; Use this option to keep the pixel time the same 
      and change exposure instead.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Scan rate and Set Exposure for Max Scan Rate</b></p>
    <p>
      The line labeled 'Scan rate' shows the speed at which the beam moves during the 
      STEM scan, in microns per millisecond.&nbsp; Because of limitations on beam 
      deflection, images are either shifted or distorted when the scan rate is above a 
      certain level (roughly 0.5 micron/msec).&nbsp; As scan rate increases, at first 
      an image will just be shifted, then it will appear stretched, then it may have 
      serious curved distortions at the side of the image where the scan starts, 
      especially on an FEI scope.&nbsp; The camera property 'MaximumScanRate' can be 
      used to define both a maximum limit on scan rate, and a lower 'advisable' limit 
      that it may be preferable not to exceed.&nbsp; If this property is defined, then 
      the scan rate output shows three stars when the rate is above the maximum limit, 
      and one star when it is between the advisable and maximum limit.&nbsp; Also, the
      <b>Set Exposure for Max Scan Rate</b> button will be enabled and can be used to 
      set the exposure time so that the maximum limit is not exceeded.&nbsp; Another 
      consequence of having this property defined is that tasks such as eucentricity 
      will use an exposure time that is long enough to avoid exceeding the maximum 
      scan rate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Dynamic focusing</b></p>
    <p>
      Use this option to have defocus change progressively during image acquisition in 
      order to keep a tilted specimen in focus.&nbsp; The option is enabled as long as 
      the exposure time is long enough to allow at least five focus steps during the 
      acquisition.&nbsp; Steps are taken every 40 msec on FEI scopes or 80 msec on 
      JEOL scopes, unless set differently by the property 'DynamicFocusInterval'.</p>
    <p>
      For FEI STEM, a line will appear above this checkbox showing what kind of timing 
      information is available for the current acquisition parameters.&nbsp; An 
      accurate estimate of flyback time is important for having the focus change at 
      the right rate during the scan.&nbsp;&nbsp; The status line may show that a 
      measured flyback time is available, which is very good; that it is being 
      interpolated between measured times, which may be very good or bad depending on 
      exposure time; that it is being extrapolated from measured times, which is more 
      likely to be problematic; or that it is unavailable, which is bad.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Line Sync</b></p>
    <p>
      Use this option with DigiScan to synchronize the start of each scan line with 
      the cycles of the electrical supply.&nbsp; This can radically increase exposure 
      time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Channels to acquire:</b></p>
    <p>
      If you have more than one STEM detector, the detector(s) to use are selected in 
      one or more combo boxes.&nbsp; If you can acquire only one channel at a time, 
      then there is just one combo box showing the available detectors.&nbsp; If you 
      can acquire multiple channels simultaneously, then there will be one combo box 
      per possible simultaneous channel.&nbsp; Any detector can be selected in any 
      combo box.&nbsp; The order of selection determines the order in which images 
      appear in SerialEM buffers; namely, the first channel will be in buffer A, the 
      second in buffer B, etc.&nbsp; For FEI STEM, only the detectors selected in the 
      microscope user interface when the dialog is opened are available.&nbsp; 
      Unavailable detectors will be marked as 'NA' in the combo boxes.&nbsp; Such 
      detectors can be left as the choice for particular channels; the program will 
      simply skip them when acquiring an image, as long as there is at least one 
      available detector to acquire from.</p>
