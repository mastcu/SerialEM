      <P> start the calibration of coma versus image shift after setting </P>
This dialog box allows you to calibrate how beam tilt must be changed to achieve coma-free
      alignment when an image shift is imposed.&nbsp; It has entries for the maximum image shift
       to be tested and a rotation angle for the 
        image shift vectors to apply.&nbsp; The calibration involves running the
      <a href="menu_focus.htm#grabage">Coma-free Alignment by CTF</a>
      routine to measure the beam tilt needed at four locations. At each position, 
    the measured beam tilt is applied temporarily and astigmatism is measured so 
    that its dependence on image shift is also calibrated.&nbsp; The calibration can then 
    be applied by the multi-shot routine (see <a href="menu_navigator.htm#ID_OPTIONS_SETMULTI">Set
      Multi-Shot Parameters</a>) and with several script commands. When this dialog 
    is open in Low Dose mode, the areas that will be tested are drawn on a View or 
    Search image.&nbsp; With a rotation of 0, image shift will be changed in +/-X 
    then in +/-Y by the amount corresponding to the shift in microns entered in the
    <strong>Distance to measure in each direction</strong> text box.&nbsp; When a 
    non-zero value is set in the <strong>Rotation of measurement vectors </strong>
    text box, these basic vectors are rotated by that amount.&nbsp; With these 
    features, you can avoid running the coma-free alignment over a hole.</p>
    <p>
      It is important to realize that this calibration strictly applies only under the
      current illumination conditions (specifically, the C2/C3 lens setting or
      illuminated area, and the probe mode or alpha setting).&nbsp; When near parallel illumination, it may not change much
      with beam changes; otherwise it might change considerably.&nbsp; This has
      several consequences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It may be necessary to do the calibration once per session, after setting up
        the illumination to be used for acquisition.</li>
      <li>The calibration should be done in Low Dose mode if acquisition is to be done
        in Low Dose mode</li>
      <li>Because it depends on your settings for illumination, the calibration will be
        saved in your settings file, not shared with others using other settings files.</li>
      <li>The calibration can be checked with the the <strong>Test Multishot Positions</strong> 
        button in <a href="menu_navigator.htm#hid_options_setmulti">Multi-Shot Parameters</a> 
        dialog and with the script command 'TestNextMultiShot 2'
        (see <a href="hidd_multi_shot_setup.htm#testing">Testing Image Location and Coma Adjustment</a>) 
        ,or with a script like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; FixComaByCTF<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ImageShiftByMicrons 2 0 1 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Delay 3<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; FixComaByCTF 1 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; FixAstigmatismByCTF 1 1<br />
        where you could omit the first FixComaByCTF if you have already done the
        coma-free alignment, the &quot;2 0&quot; can be replaced by an image shift of your choice,
        the astigmatism test could be omitted, and you could add additional tests at other image shift positions.&nbsp; Such a
        script could be used to explore how much the adjusted beam tilt gets off when
        the beam intensity is changed.</li>
