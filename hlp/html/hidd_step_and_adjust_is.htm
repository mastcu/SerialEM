      <P> This dialog opens when you press the <strong>Step To and Adjust IS</strong> 
        button in <a href="menu_navigator.htm#hid_options_setmulti">Multiple Record 
        Setup</a> dialog when in Low Dose mode and it allows you to specify which Low 
        Dose area to take images with, what magnification to use, and whether to change 
        the defocus offset if using View or Search.&nbsp; It is necessary to specify 
        this in advance so that the initial image shift can be applied after going to 
        conditions in which images will be taken.</P>
    <P> <strong>Low Dose area to use</strong></P>
    <P> &nbsp;<strong>Record</strong> is always available; <strong>View</strong> and
      <strong>Search</strong> are offered as options if they are not currently set to 
      be in low magnification mode.&nbsp; Using anything but a higher magnification, 
      near that of Record, has the same limitations and requirements as when initially 
      setting the areas: images should be taken near focus unless there are good 
      calibrations for the effects of high defocus.&nbsp; If there are image shift 
      boundaries between the magnification to be used and the Record magnification 
      (i.e., such that an applied image shift does not produce the same shift on the 
      specimen at the two maginifications), then there need to be adequate 
      calibrations of rotation angle and pixel size (i.e., &#39;RotationAndPixel&#39; 
      properties entries) to allow the image shift to be translated accurately from 
      where it is measured to where it is used for acquisition.</P>
      <p><b>Take image after shifting to position</b></p>
      <P>Check this option to have an image taken automatically after shifting to each 
        position.</P> 
    <P> <strong>Magnification to use</strong></P>
    <P> The choices here are the <strong>Current mag of area,</strong> the <strong>Mag 
      at which shifts were recorded</strong>, and a selected <strong>Other mag</strong>.&nbsp; 
      When you have selected to acquire with the Record area, the latter two are 
      liable to be successful if the magnification is a similarly high one; chosing a 
      much lower magnification would have the same potential problems as using View or 
      Search at such a magnification.&nbsp; If you have selected View or Search, using 
      another magnification may impose a shift on the area unless the magnifications 
      are well-aligned.&nbsp; Since all positions are going to be visited, such a 
      shift is not an intrinsic problem, unless it prevents you from finding the first 
      hole to be positioned at.&nbsp; Note that there is no automatic change in intensity 
      when switching to a different magnification; you will need to make such changes 
      yourself.</P>
    <P> <strong>Change defocus offset to</strong></P>
    <P> This option is available with View or Serach and allows you to switch from the 
      currently set defocus offset to a smaller one if necessary.&nbsp; Like using a 
      different magnification, changing the defocus offset may impose a shift that 
      needs to be compensated for when positioning on the first hole.</P>
    <P> Press <strong>OK</strong> to start the procedure; the program will go to the 
      Low Dose area, with modifications if any, shift to the first position, and allow 
      you to take images and store image shift values.</P>
    <P> Any changes made to the chosen Low Dose area, either specified here or imposed 
      by you after starting the procedure, will be restored when the procedure is 
      finished.</P>
