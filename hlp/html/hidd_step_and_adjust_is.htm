      Dialog</FONT></B></P>
      <P> This dialog opens when you press the <strong>Step To &amp; Adjust IS...</strong> 
        button in <a href="hidd_multi_shot_setup.htm">Multiple Record 
        Setup</a> dialog when in Low Dose mode and it allows you to specify which Low 
        Dose area to take images with, what magnification to use, and whether to change 
        the defocus offset if using View or Search.&nbsp; It is necessary to specify 
        this in advance so that the initial image shift can be applied after going to 
        conditions in which images will be taken.&nbsp; If parameters are set 
        appropriately, there is an option to run the procedure automatically.</P>
    <P> <strong>Low Dose area and images to use</strong></P>
    <P> <strong>Record (Preview images)</strong> is always available; <strong>View</strong> and
      <strong>Search</strong> are offered as options if they are not currently set to 
      be in low magnification mode.&nbsp; As the name implies, with <strong>Record</strong> <strong>
      (Preview images)</strong>, 
      images will be taken with the Preview parameter set.&nbsp; A <strong>2 x 2 
      Preview Montage</strong> is also always available, and a <strong>2 x 3 Preview Montage</strong> 
      option (or <strong>3 x 2) </strong>is&nbsp;present to give an image closer to 
      square when the current camera has an aspect ratio over 1.33 (e.g., a K3 
      camera).&nbsp; When one of these is selected, the program will open a temporary 
      file for these montages and remove it at the end of the procedure.&nbsp; These montage options allow the 
      adjustment to be done at a magnification closer to that of Record, where the 
      image shifts are liable to be sufficiently close to the ones needed for Record.</P>
    <P> Using anything but a higher magnification, 
      near that of Record, has the same limitations and requirements as when initially 
      setting the areas: images should be taken near focus unless there are good 
      calibrations for the effects of high defocus.&nbsp; If there are image shift 
      boundaries between the magnification to be used and the Record magnification 
      (i.e., such that an applied image shift does not produce the same shift on the 
      specimen at the two maginifications), then there need to be adequate 
      calibrations of rotation angle and pixel size (i.e., &#39;RotationAndPixel&#39; 
      properties entries) to allow the image shift to be translated accurately from 
      where it is measured to where it is used for acquisition.</P>
    <P> <strong>Set Preview exposure to</strong></P>
    <P> Select this option and enter the desired exposure time for the Preview images.&nbsp; 
      It will probably be necessary to have a longer exposure time when running the 
      procedure automatically.</P>
    <P> <strong>Magnification to use</strong></P>
    <P> The choices here are the <strong>Current mag of area,</strong> the <strong>Mag 
      at which shifts were recorded</strong>, and a selected <strong>Other mag</strong>.&nbsp; 
      When you have selected to acquire with the Record area, the latter two are 
      liable to be successful if the magnification is a similarly high one; chosing a 
      much lower magnification would have the same potential problems as using View or 
      Search at such a magnification.&nbsp; If you have selected View or Search, using 
      another magnification may impose a shift on the area unless the magnifications 
      are well-aligned.&nbsp; Since all positions are going to be visited, such a 
      shift is not an intrinsic problem, unless it prevents you from finding the first 
      hole to be positioned at.&nbsp; There is an automatic change in intensity when 
      switching to a different magnification, but it could result in the beam not 
      being centered well enough.</P>
    <P> <strong>Change defocus offset to</strong></P>
    <P> This option is available with View or Serach and allows you to switch from the 
      currently set defocus offset to a smaller one if necessary.&nbsp; Like using a 
      different magnification, changing the defocus offset may impose a shift that 
      needs to be compensated for when positioning on the first hole.</P>
    <P> Press <strong>OK</strong> to start the procedure; the program will go to the 
      Low Dose area, with modifications if any, shift to the first position, and allow 
      you to take images and store image shift values.</P>
    <P> Any changes made to the chosen Low Dose area, either specified here or imposed 
      by you after starting the procedure, will be restored when the procedure is 
      finished.</P>
    <P> <strong>Do procedure automatically with:</strong></P>
    <P> Check this option to run the sequence of operations automatically on a regular 
      hole pattern after you press Start.&nbsp; In order for it be available, you must 
      set the <strong>Hole size</strong> within 10% and select imaging conditions that 
      will make the hole size be between 0.33 and 0.75 of the minimum dimension of the 
      image (or between 0.17 and 0.75 for hex grids).&nbsp; The status line at the 
      bottom of the group box will indicate why conditions are not met or how they are 
      being met.&nbsp; When using single images, the program will crop the images down 
      to a usable size if that contains enough pixels, or you can set the camera 
      parameters to acquire a subset.&nbsp; No cropping is available with montages.</P>
    <P> You can choose to have hole positions be adjusted either with <strong>
      Cross-correlation</strong> or with <strong>Hole centering</strong>.&nbsp; With <strong>Cross-correlation</strong>, the first image is used as a reference, so 
      it does not matter whether the hole is off-center, as long as most of it is 
      there and there is not much extraneous material.&nbsp; Images at the remainder 
      of the holes are correlated with the first one.&nbsp; The cross-correlation can 
      fail if the hole edge is not distinct enough, the size is not the same between 
      holes, or if the correlation is thrown off by other contrasting material.&nbsp; 
      At the end, single images are left in successive buffers with the last one in A 
      and the reference in D, 
      while montage overviews are in successive buffers with the last one in B.</P>
    <P> With <strong>Hole centering</strong>, the program calls the Hole Finder with 
      some parameters appropriate for finding one hole in an image with one or a few 
      holes, and other parameters taken from pre-existing hole-finding parameters, 
      namely as the geometry, spacing, filters, and thresholds.&nbsp; If the
      <a href="hidd_hole_finder.htm">Hole Finder</a> dialog is open when this dialog 
      is opened, the hole size is taken from there; otherwise it is based on the last 
      value used in this dialog.&nbsp; If there is hole at the center of the pattern 
      (e.g., a 3x3 rectangular pattern or a hex 
      array), the first image is taken at the center position and the hole is centered, 
      with a relatively large image shift allowed.&nbsp; Images after that should be 
      closer to center and require less shifting.&nbsp; At the end, all images are 
      availlable for inspection is successive buffers, just as with cross-correlation.&nbsp; 
      The method can give a poor result if montage pieces do not align well enough or if there is 
      material intruding along one side that throws off the center measurement for a 
      hole.&nbsp; Probably this method should be used only after finding 
      cross-correlation inadequate.</P>
    <P> With either method, the entry for <strong>Maximum shift as fraction of hole 
      size</strong> determines whether a measured shift will be done; if a shift is 
      too large, the procedure will be aborted.</P>
    <P> Before starting, pick an area with relatively clean holes at the corners of 
      the pattern to be assessed, which is determined by the current Multiple Record 
      settings.&nbsp; When using Preview images or montages and starting with a View 
      or Search image, be sure that the View or Search shift offset is well-calibrated 
      (see <a href="hidd_lowdose.htm#viewShiftOffset">Shift offsets for View and Search</a>).&nbsp; Center
      on the central hole or center of the pattern and press <strong>Start</strong>.</P>
      <p><b>Take image after shifting to position</b></p>
      <P>Check this option to have an image taken automatically after shifting to each 
        position, when not running the procedure automatically.</P>
    <P><strong>Close</strong> and <strong>Cancel</strong></P>
    <P><strong>Close</strong> will close the dialog without running, but saving the 
      parameters.&nbsp; <strong>Cancel</strong> will not save the parameters.</P>
