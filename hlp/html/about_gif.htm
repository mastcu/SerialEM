      <P>SerialEM allows convenient use of an energy filter (GIF or omega filter) and efficient tilt 
        series acquisition with filtering. For FEI scopes, it relies on the EFTEM software being 
        installed.&nbsp; On JEOL scopes, it works with an omega filter or with a 
        post-column GIF, where it recognizes the GIF mode and may be able to control it. 
        It provides a number of additional features when used with a GIF.</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>
          Automatic switching between regular lens mode and EFTEM 
          or GIF lens mode when the 
          screen is raised or lowered. For the occasions when you need to see the 
          constricted beam of EFTEM lens mode on the screen, you just toggle this 
          automatic switching off.</LI>
        <LI>
          Automatic switching between upper camera and GIF camera.</LI>
        <LI>
          Automatic changing of magnification to provide the least change between the 
          pixel sizes on the upper camera and on the GIF camera.</LI>
        <LI>
          Automatic intensity adjustment so that the electrons per pixel per second will 
          be the same on the GIF camera as on the upper camera.</LI>
        <LI>
          Integration with low dose mode so that different filter settings can be used 
          for pictures of the different low dose areas.</LI></UL>
      <P>Even without SerialEM, there are numerous ways to control filter settings: the 
        EFTEM panel in the FEI Microscope User Interface (MUI), the Autofilter palette in 
        DigitalMicrograph, and the Filter Control program in GMS 1 or its equivalent 
        dialog in DM in GMS 2. SerialEM tries to be 
        a good citizen among this crowd and respond to changes made in other 
        interfaces. The recommendation from FEI was (and may still be) that the filter be controlled only through 
        the MUI. This is probably sound advice for 
        any actions that cannot be done through SerialEM. Specifically, this includes 
        aligning the zero loss peak (ZLP), tuning the GIF, and performing spectroscopy.</P>
      <P>It is important to distinguish between SerialEM's EFTEM mode and the  
        EFTEM or GIF lens mode. When EFTEM mode is on in SerialEM, there are many 
        implications, but the and FEI scope may not actually be in EFTEM lens mode unless the 
        screen is raised.&nbsp; The same would occur on a JEOL scope if SerialEM can 
        control the GIF mode.</P>
      <P>The biggest problem in using the GIF for tilt series is that there may be an 
        energy shift when changing to lower magnifications for various alignment tasks. 
        If the slit is in, the zero loss peak may shift out of the energy range of the 
        slit, and the task will fail. One solution would be to remove the slit when 
        going to lower magnification, but this would cause an unpredictable and 
        potentially large increase in intensity that could saturate the camera. The 
        solution in SerialEM is to calibrate the energy shifts and apply these 
        automatically when changing magnifications, so that the slit can be left in and 
        will still be centered at the lower magnification. The program will also apply 
        energy offsets to accommodate changes in slit width. These capabilities allow 
        you to explore different magnifications and slit widths without having to align 
        the ZLP repeatedly.</P>
      <P>SerialEM implements the three standard imaging modes: unfiltered (with the slit 
        out), filtered to record only zero-loss electrons, and filtered to record 
        electrons with a specific range of energy losses. Once filtering is selected, 
        it is possible to switch between zero-loss and a specific energy loss simply by 
        toggling the 'Zero loss' checkbox; however, if you want a different slit width 
        in the two cases you need to adjust it each time you switch between them. See <A HREF="hidd_filtercontrol.htm">
          Filter Control panel</A> for more details.</P>
      <P>The Filter Control Panel in SerialEM includes a button to refine the alignment 
        of the ZLP. The procedure is referred to as a refinement because it will work 
        only if the ZLP is already close to aligned, say within 10 eV. The Align ZLP 
        function available in other interfaces must be used for initial alignment, 
        because it is capable of finding the ZLP from many eV away. However, the refine 
        ZLP procedure will align the ZLP even when it is a very small fraction of the 
        total electrons, because it concentrates on the drop in signal as the slit is 
        moved off of the left edge of the ZLP. Thus, once a thick specimen is in, the 
        refine ZLP procedure may be more reliable than the Align ZLP procedure run from 
        elsewhere.</P>
      <P><B>Steps for Using the GIF on an FEI Scope</B></P>
      <OL>
        <LI>
        Be sure to start Filter Control (for GMS 1), then DigitalMicrograph, then SerialEM after 
        DigitalMicrograph reports Dynamic cameras registered in its Results window. 
        <LI>
        Go to a mid-range magnification like 20,500 with the screen down. Adjust the 
        beam to a spot size and screen current that will get you through the tuning 
        procedure without having to adjust intensity. (Specific values vary widely; if 
        you have to turn the beam down in the First Order isochromaticity adjustment, 
        put the screen down when you get through the tuning and note the current for 
        the next time.)
        <LI>
          Activate EFTEM mode in the <A HREF="hidd_filtercontrol.htm">Filter Control panel</A>
        and take a picture through the GIF just to verify function.
        <LI>
        Set the slit width to 10 to 20 ev; 20 seems preferable.
        <LI>
        Press 'Align ZLP' on the FEI EFTEM panel.
        <LI>
       Press 'Tune GIF' on the FEI EFTEM panel.
        <LI>
        Switch to the magnification that you will be using for final image acquisition. 
        Lower the screen and adjust the beam to fill the screen with enough intensity 
        for a good gain reference (5 - 10 na?).
         <LI>
        Raise the screen and take a gain reference.
        <LI>
          Now you should assess the adequacy of the calibration of mag-dependent energy 
          shifts (unless you will be working in low dose mode and having the slit out for 
          pictures of the View area). To do this:</LI></OL>
      <UL>
        <LI>
        Set Trial parameters for a fast picture with moderately high counts, e.g. 256 x 
        256, center half area, 0.05 - 0.1 second exposre.
        <LI>
        Turn on intensity zoom.
        <LI>
        Set slit to 15 ev.
        <LI>
        Go to a low mag like 5600. Take pictures with the slit in and the slit out and 
        measure the mean counts (Ctrl-I).
        <LI>
        Repeat for other low mags that may be used in tasks (e.g. 4500 and 3000).
        <LI>
          If you see some serious beam loss or dark spots on the edges with the slit in, 
          you need to calibrate the mag-dependent shifts, as described in <A HREF="menu_calibration.htm#hid_calibration_magenergyshifts">
            Mag Energy Shifts</A> . Enter the highest mag that you will use and accept 
          the defaults for the other parameters.</LI></UL>
