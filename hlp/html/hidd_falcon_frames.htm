    <p>
      This dialog allows you to control the saving of 
      either intermediate frames from a 
      Falcon camera or variably-sized sums of frames from a K2 camera.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>
      <i>For the Falcon camera</i>, an exposure consists of a certain number of 
      readouts at a fixed interval, referred to here as camera frames.&nbsp; The intermediate frames that get 
      saved are sums of successive sets of camera frames.&nbsp; The controls in this 
      dialog let you select which camera frames are summed and saved, and this is the only 
      way to set the exposure time integrated in the saved frames.</p>
    <p>
      <i>For the Falcon 3 camera</i>, when alignment in the Falcon processor is 
      selected for this parameter set, the constraints for alignment are imposed as 
      changes are made here.&nbsp; Specifically, a minimum exposure time is 
      maintained, depending on whether linear or counting mode is selected; and the 
      summed frames are constrained to either a single camera frame or a multiple of 6 
      frames.&nbsp; The only way to switch to saving single camera frames is to type 
      one line with the total number of camera frames and a 1 into the box for the 
      list of frame sums.&nbsp; Once single-frame saving is specify, it should be 
      maintained as you change exposure time.&nbsp; Similarly, the only way to switch 
      back to multiples of 6 is to type in a line with some number of summed frames 
      and a 6.</p>
    <p>
      <i>For the K2 camera</i>, the exposure time of the camera frames available for 
      saving can be set in the main camera setup dialog, and this dialog is needed 
      only if you want to save frames with different durations from a single exposure.&nbsp; In this case, 
      the stack of images prepared by DigitalMicrograph at the selected frame time 
      will be referred to as camera frames, and the sums saved by the SerialEMCCD plugin 
      are referred to as summed frames.&nbsp; Note that DM&#39;s lengthy time to prepare the 
      camera frames is proportional to the number of camera frames, so the total time for 
      saving the data will reflect primarily this number rather than the number of 
      summed frames saved.&nbsp; If you want to sum numerous camera frames from later in 
      the exposure, it may be significantly faster to take two separate exposures with 
      different frame times.</p>
    <p>
      An unequal distribution of 
      camera frames among the summed frames, i.e., variable frame 
      durations,&nbsp;is created by typing the actual distribution into the large box 
      at the bottom. The box is formatted to hold a pair of numbers on each line.&nbsp; 
      The first number of a pair is the number of successive summed frames of a particular 
      duration; the second number is the number of camera frames in each of those 
      summed frames.&nbsp; 
      The program will remember whatever distribution is imposed when you enter such 
      numbers or change the values in the list.&nbsp; Thereafter, when you change 
      other items in the dialog, the program will reapportion camera frames among 
      summed frames 
      so as to maintain this distribution. In fact, even when this dialog is not open, 
      changes in exposure time or frame time will cause the program to reapportion 
      camera frames, provided that frame summing is enabled.&nbsp; Note that whenever a 
      given number of camera frames does not divide equally among a set of summed frames, the 
      extra camera frames will be added to the later summed frames in that set.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Exposure time</b></p>
    <p>
      This text box is initialized with the current exposure time for this parameter 
      set, but the time can be changed here.&nbsp; The exposure is constrained to be a 
      multiple of the camera frame time.&nbsp; <i>For the Falcon 2</i>, the total number of 
      camera frames in the 
      exposure is the sum of ones selected to be skipped at the beginning and end and the total 
      included in the saved frames.&nbsp; When this time is changed, a new number of 
      camera frames is distributed among the current number of summed frames.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Camera frame time</b></p>
    <p>
      <i>For the K2</i>, this text box contains the current frame time for the 
      parameter set, which can be changed here.&nbsp; When the time is changed, the 
      exposure is kept constant and a new number of camera frames is distributed among the 
      current number of summed frames.</p>
    <p>
      Below this entry is a display of the minimum and maximum summed frames times 
      implied by the current entries for frame summing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Number of frames to save</b></p>
    <p>Use this spinner to select how many summed frames to save from the exposure.&nbsp; 
      Changing this value will generally cause the same total camera frames being saved to 
      be distributed among a different number of summed frames.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Skip before start</b></p>
    <p>
      <i>For the Falcon 2</i>, use this spinner to set whether to leave out any camera frames at the beginning of 
      the exposure, which may have shuttering effects.&nbsp; Changing this value will 
      change the exposure time.&nbsp; For Falcon 3, the first and last frames with 
      shuttering effects are automatically discarded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Total to save</b></p>
    <p>This spinner reflects the the total number of 
      camera frames that will be included in 
      the saved frames.&nbsp; Changing this value will increase the exposure time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Skip after end</b></p>
    <p>
      <i>For the Falcon 2</i>, use this spinner to leave out camera frames at the end of the exposure; such 
      camera frames may also have shuttering effects.&nbsp; Changing this value will 
      change the exposure time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>List of frame sums</b></p>
    <p>The format of this text box was explained above.&nbsp; 
      Be aware of these points: 1) Type Tab or click elsewhere in the dialog to have 
      the program read your changes.&nbsp; The program will not process your changes 
      until you do this, so you need to make a complete and consistent set of changes 
      before doing so.&nbsp; 2) There must be at least two numbers on 
      each line, and numbers after the second one are ignored.&nbsp; 3) The program 
      will rewrite the list into the box after you change it.&nbsp; 4) Thus you can 
      simply add a new second value on a line without erasing the existing one 
      yourself.&nbsp; 5) Changes here will affect exposure time and number of saved 
      frames and camera frames.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Equalize</b></p>
    <p>Use this button to eliminate whatever unequal distribution of 
      camera frames has been 
      imposed by typing into the list.&nbsp; This is useful for the Falcon, but for 
      the K2, simply disable saving summed frames instead.</p>
