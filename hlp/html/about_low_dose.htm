    <P>The essence of low dose mode is that focusing and tracking operations for a tilt 
      series are done in a location separate from the area being recorded, to spare 
      that area from unnecessary beam exposure. In order to provide accurate focusing 
      and tracking, these separate areas must be displaced along the tilt axis from 
      the center of the recording area. SerialEM's low dose mode provides five 
      'areas' that can be defined to have different settings of magnification, spot 
      size, and beam intensity, centered in up to 3 different locations. They are 
      named for the corresponding camera parameter sets that are used to acquire images 
      from them. The areas are:</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        Record area - the area where the region being recorded is located. The 
        magnification and beam should be set up for the final image acquisition. Both 
        Record and Preview capture images from this area; the Record camera parameters 
        would be set up for the final acquisition, while Preview parameters would be 
        set up for a highly binned, low exposure image.</LI>
      <LI>
        View area - this area is centered on the Record area. The magnification should 
        be low for several reasons: to provide an overview of a larger area, to 
        minimize specimen exposure, and to provide reliable tracking in the various 
        SerialEM 'tasks' that require low magnification views. Taking an image with the 
        View camera parameters will acquire from this area. View camera parameters 
        should be set up for a binned, low exposure image.</LI>
      <LI>
        Focus area - this area is displaced along the tilt axis from the Record area. 
        The beam must be set up so as not to intrude on the Record area. Taking an 
        image with the Focus camera parameters will acquire from this area.</LI>
      <LI>
        Trial area - like the Focus area, this area is displaced along the tilt axis and 
        the beam must be constricted. Taking an image with the Trial camera parameters 
        will acquire from this area.</LI>
      <LI>
        Search area - this area 
        is centered on the Record area and could be set up for even lower magnification 
        than the View area, or with other differences in parameters.&nbsp; Taking an 
        image with the Search camera parameters will acquire from this area.&nbsp; 
        However, the option to <a href="#hid_camera_useviewforsearch">Use View for Search</a> 
        in the Camera menu can be used to simplify the situation and acquire with View 
        camera parameters, even though a Search command, button, or script command is 
        used to take the image.&nbsp; The following shows the relationships when that 
        option is selected.</LI>
    </OL>
    <P align="center"><img  src="../images/lowDoseAreas.jpg" />&nbsp;</P>
    <P>Although the Focus and Trial areas can be set up with completely independent 
      parameters, it is most convenient to constrain them to be identical. This saves 
      the effort of setting up the beam for both areas, avoids the image shift 
      settling time required for getting between them, and minimizes the total range 
      of image shift needed for low dose work. The latter factor is currently 
      important on the 300 KV Tecnai or Polara because the objective aperture begins to occlude 
      the image area for relatively small image shifts. Image shift is also quite 
      limited on the JEOL 2100/2200 unless the scope has the high power image shift 
      option, although projector shift is usually used for image shift to minimize 
      this problem.</P>
    <P><i>Microscope Parameters Stored. </i>&nbsp;The parameters that can be set separately for each low dose area are the 
      magnification, spot size, beam brightness, filter settings if there is an 
      energy filter. The latter include whether the slit is in, and the slit width 
      and energy loss.&nbsp; On an FEI scope, the probe mode (nanoprobe versus 
      microprobe) is also stored. On the JEOL, the alpha setting can also be set separately, 
      although no more than two alpha settings can be used. 
      Absolute beam position is not stored, but a relative beam shift between areas 
      can be set. Diffraction mode can be used for any area, although it is likely to 
      be useful only for the Search area. If diffraction is used, the camera length 
      and diffraction focus are stored as parameters.</P>
    <P><i>Special Features in Low Dose Mode.</i>&nbsp; In low dose mode, numerous features of SerialEM operate differently.    <UL>
      <LI>
        Tasks that use low magnification tracking (finding eucentricity, reversing 
        tilt, and resetting image shifts) will automatically use View images. Walking 
        up will use images of the Trial area.
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Autoalignment operates with two autoalign buffers. A Record or Preview image 
        will be aligned to the image in the first autoalign buffer, whereas a Trial or 
        Focus image will be aligned to the second autoalign buffer. The 'Align to' 
        button in the <A HREF="hidd_alignfocus.htm">Image Alignment &amp; Focus control 
          panel</A> will indicate which are the two autoalign buffers.</LI>
      <LI>
        Autoalignment will work with the beam constricted inside the camera field 
        because autoalign will detect dark areas in the corners of the image (namely, 
        areas outside the beam) and use only the largest rectangle inside these areas 
        for alignment.</LI>
      <LI>
        The Tilt Series Controller uses D and E as the two autoalign buffers. It uses 
        images of the Trial area for tracking, but it also maintains a reference image 
        from the Record area, so that each new Record image is aligned to that 
        reference and then replaces it.</LI>
      <LI>
        If you choose to adjust intensities automatically during a tilt series, only 
        the intensity of the Record area will be adjusted.</LI>
      <LI>
          Since the View and Search areas often have very different magnifications from 
          each other and from the other areas, display zoom will be remembered separately 
          for these two areas.&nbsp; This should make it easier to recognize similar 
          features when toggling between images from the different areas.</LI></UL>
    <P><i>Setting Properties of Areas.</i>&nbsp; You can set the properties of a low dose area by making it be the current area 
      then adjusting its features. The current area and its beam properties are 
      displayed on the second line of the <A HREF="hidd_lowdose.htm">Low Dose control 
        panel</A> . There are two ways to set the current area: take an image of 
      the area, or select the area with the 'Go to area / show 
      when screen down' radio buttons. As that label indicates, this radio button 
      selection has two consequences: the area is changed when the selection is 
      changed, and the selected area is also set when the screen is lowered. For the search area, there is also a button to 
      press, since there is no image acquisition in this area. You can adjust most 
      properties of the current area by turning on the 'Continuous update of mag 
      &amp; beam' checkbox. With this option on, any changes in the magnification, 
      spot size, condenser lens setting, or energy filter settings will change the 
      defined properties of the area.&nbsp; However, beam position is still a global 
      feature that applies to all low dose areas, so a change in beam position is not 
      recorded with &#39;Continuous update&#39; on.&nbsp; (A relative beam position can be set 
      for each area with a separate control.) If the option is 
      off, you can change these features temporarily, but the stored properties of 
      the area will be reimposed next time a picture is taken of the area.</P>
    <P>If you want to make initial adjustments to the properties of an area with no 
      exposure of the specimen at all, then select the area with a radio button and 
      adjust its features.</P>
    <P><i>Setting Positions of Trial/Focus Areas. </i>&nbsp;The positions of the Focus and Trial areas can be set by selecting the Focus or 
      Trial radio buttons in the 'Define position of area' box. Once one of these 
      buttons is selected, two pieces of information become available at the bottom 
      of the <A HREF="hidd_lowdose.htm">Low Dose control panel</A> . One is a text 
      box showing the distance along the tilt axis from the Record area to the area 
      being defined, where negative and positive numbers reflect opposite directions 
      along the axis. The other display shows essentially a safety factor for 
      spillover of the beam from the area being defined into the Record area; it is 
      the distance between a circle circumscribing the area being defined and the 
      edge of the Record area.</P>
    <P>There are several ways to adjust the position of the area being defined. In 
      addition to simply typing in a distance in the text box, the most convenient is 
      to take a picture of the View area. The position of the area being defined 
      relative to the center of the View will be shown by a green cross, and you can 
      click with the left mouse button to select a new position. On a View image, the 
      Record area and the area being defined will also be shown with a box, with a 
      circle circumscribing the area being defined.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Offsets.</i>&nbsp; Several different &quot;offsets&quot; can be set by different 
      procedures:</P>
    <ul>
      <li>A defocus offset can be applied when going to the View area in order to 
        increase contrast for the View images.&nbsp; The value can be set with a spinner 
        in the 'Offsets for View' box of the <A HREF="hidd_lowdose.htm">Low Dose control panel</A>.</li>
      <li>The View area can be centered on the Record area by recording a shift offset 
        for the View area.&nbsp; This is done by centering a feature in Record, then 
        taking a View image and shifting that feature to the center; see
        <a href="hidd_lowdose.htm#viewShiftOffset">Shift offset for View</a> for 
        details.</li>
      <li>Beam shifts can be imposed to center the beam independently in each area using 
        controls in the 'Additional beam shift' box.&nbsp; The procedure is to center 
        the beam in the Record area then go to other areas and record the additional 
        beam shift required to center the beam by checking and unchecking the 'Set' box.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        See <a href="hidd_lowdose.htm#addedBeamShift">
        Additional beam shift</a> for details.</li>
      <li>Added beam tilts can also be recorded at the same time as the beam shift, if 
        this enabled by a property Setting.&nbsp; On an FEI scope, one can also impose a dark 
        field beam tilt for the Trial and Focus areas, which might be a way to keep the 
        beam from being occluded by the objective aperture.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <P><i>Balancing Shifts.</i>&nbsp; The final concept that needs explaining is that of balancing the shifts. On the 
      300 KV Tecnai, one should think of the objective aperture as defining a circle 
      within which the specimen can be imaged by means of image shift. If the Record 
      area is in the middle of this circle, then the Focus and Trial areas will be 
      displaced to near the edge of the circle, and there may not be much range of 
      image shift left for tracking during the tilt series. Given these limitations, 
      it is preferable to arrange the Record and Trial areas so that the center of 
      the circle is midway between them, because then neither one will be as close to 
      the edge of the usable circle as the Trial area is with the Record area in the 
      center. This is accomplished by pressing the 'Balance Shifts' button. The 
      change can be undone by pressing the 'Center Unshifted' button, so-called 
      because it will recenter the areas that are considered unshifted (Record and 
      View).</P>
    <P>Your low dose parameters are saved to your settings file and will be restored 
      when you restart SerialEM. If you have never started low dose before, the areas 
      are undefined, and they will acquire the current microscope settings when they 
      are first activated. Two sets of parameters are stored, one for a nonGIF camera 
      and one for a GIF camera.</P>
    <P><B>Steps for Initially Setting up Low Dose</B></P>
    <P>It is somewhat difficult to get low dose set up initially, but following a set 
      procedure may be helpful.</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        Before going to low dose mode, set the magnification and beam strength that you 
        will want for the View area.</LI>
      <LI>
        Turn on low dose mode and take a picture of the View area.</LI>
      <LI>
        Turn on 'Continuous update' to adjust the View area properties further. Be sure 
        to set any View-area-specific GIF settings.</LI>
      <LI>
        Copy View properties to the Record area with the 'R' button in 'Copy current 
        area mag &amp; beam' radio group.</LI>
      <LI>
        Take a Preview or Record picture to go to the Record area, then turn on 
        'Continuous update'.</LI>
      <LI>
        Adjust the magnification for the Record area, and any specific filter settings.</LI>
      <LI>
        Adjust the beam strength by taking a Preview or Record and selecting 'Set 
        intensity' in the Tasks menu. Enter the desired number of counts in a Record 
        image. If there is a big change, this may take 2-3 iterations.</LI>
      <LI>
        If the beam is too small, reduce the spot size; if it is too large (i.e., you 
        are concerned about extra exposure to the Trial/Focus areas), then increase the 
        spot size.</LI>
      <LI>
        If you want to get the beam to be not much bigger than the camera field of 
        view, you need to condense it so that you can see the whole beam, then expand 
        by a controlled amount. See step 14.</LI>
      <LI>
        Make sure 'Keep Focus and Trial identical' is selected and copy Record 
        properties to the Trial area with the 'T' copy button.</LI>
      <LI>
        Select the radio button to define the position of the Trial area.</LI>
      <LI>
        Take a View picture. Click with the left mouse button to define a position for 
        the Trial area. Note the 'Maximum area separation' and click again to get a 
        sufficiently positive separation, or just type in a position.</LI>
      <LI>
        Take a Trial picture. Adjust area-specific filter settings (e.g., slit out).</LI>
      <LI>
        Here it is essential to get the beam constricted to just the Trial area and 
        centered on it. You can do this either by adjusting brightness and position 
        blindly or by using the 'Set Intensity' and 'Move Beam' operations in the Tasks 
        menu. When using 'Set Intensity', note that changing intensity by a certain 
        factor should change beam diameter by the square root of that factor. Also note 
        that your changes will not be accurate when the beam does not fill the camera 
        field. In general, the procedure is:</LI></OL>
    <UL>
      <LI>
        Constrict the beam enough so that you can see enough of its edge to be able to 
        center it.</LI>
      <LI>
        Change spot size if necessary to get close to the desired intensity.</LI>
      <LI>
        Center the beam.</LI>
      <LI>
        Expand the beam until it just circumscribes the area.</LI></UL>
    <P>If you are restarting with some existing parameters, you would not do all of 
      these steps. You would probably take a View and adjust its properties if 
      necessary (steps 2 and 3), take a Record and adjust its properties (steps 5-9), 
      then adjust the Trial/Focus area (steps 11-14).</P>
