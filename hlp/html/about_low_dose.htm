    <P>The essence of low dose mode is that focusing and tracking operations for a tilt
      series are done in a location separate from the area being recorded, to spare
      that area from unnecessary beam exposure. In order to provide accurate focusing
      and tracking, these separate areas must be displaced along the tilt axis from
      the center of the recording area. SerialEM's low dose mode provides five
      'areas' that can be defined to have different settings of magnification, spot
      size, and beam intensity, centered in up to 3 different locations. They are
      named for the corresponding camera parameter sets that are used to acquire images
      from them. The areas are:</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        Record area - the area where the region being recorded is located. The
        magnification and beam should be set up for the final image acquisition. Both
        Record and Preview capture images from this area; the Record camera parameters
        would be set up for the final acquisition, while Preview parameters would be
        set up for a highly binned, low exposure image.</LI>
      <LI>
        View area - this area is centered on the Record area. The magnification should
        be low (but not in Low Magnification mode) for several reasons: to provide an overview of a larger area, to
        minimize specimen exposure, and to provide reliable tracking in the various
        SerialEM 'tasks' that require lower magnification views (but the latter is not 
        essential, as explained below). Taking an image with the
        View camera parameters will acquire from this area. View camera parameters
        should be set up for a binned, low exposure image.</LI>
      <LI>
        Focus area - this area is displaced along the tilt axis from the Record area.
        The beam must be set up so as not to intrude on the Record area. Taking an
        image with the Focus camera parameters will acquire from this area.</LI>
      <LI>
        Trial area - like the Focus area, this area is displaced along the tilt axis and
        the beam must be constricted. Taking an image with the Trial camera parameters
        will acquire from this area.</LI>
      <LI>
        Search area - this area
        is centered on the Record area and could be set up for even lower magnification
        than the View area, or with other differences in parameters.&nbsp; Taking an
        image with the Search camera parameters will acquire from this area.&nbsp;
        However, the option to <a href="menu_camera.htm#hid_camera_useviewforsearch">Use View for Search</a>
        in the Camera menu can be used to simplify the situation and acquire with View
        camera parameters, even though a Search command, button, or script command is
        used to take the image.&nbsp; The following shows the relationships between Low
        Dose areas, the buttons or commands used to start an acquisition, and their
        corresponding camera parameter sets.&nbsp; The bottom part shows the situation
        when montaging, where options in the
      <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup dialog</A> control which area a
        montage is acquired from and the
        <a href="menu_camera.htm#hid_camera_useviewforsearch">Use View for Search</a>
        and <a href="menu_camera.htm#hid_camera_userecordformontage">No Mont. Map Params</a>
        options in the Camera menu control which camera parameter set is used..</LI>
    </OL>
    <P align="center"><img  src="../images/lowDoseAreas.jpg" />&nbsp;</P>
    <P>Although the Focus and Trial areas can be set up with completely independent
      parameters, it is most convenient to constrain them to be identical. This saves
      the effort of setting up the beam for both areas, avoids the image shift
      settling time required for getting between them, and minimizes the total range
      of image shift needed for low dose work. The latter factor is important on the 300 KV Tecnai or Polara because the objective aperture begins to occlude
      the image area for relatively small image shifts. Image shift is also quite
      limited on the JEOL 2100/2200 unless the scope has the high power image shift
      option, although projector shift is usually used for image shift to minimize
      this problem.</P>
    <P><i>Microscope Parameters Stored. </i>&nbsp;The parameters that can be set separately for each low dose area are the
      magnification, spot size, beam brightness, filter settings if there is an
      energy filter. The latter include whether the slit is in, and the slit width
      and energy loss.&nbsp; On a Thermo/FEI scope, the probe mode (nanoprobe versus
      microprobe) is also stored. On the JEOL, the alpha setting can also be set separately,
      although no more than two alpha settings can be used.
      Absolute beam position is not stored, but a relative beam shift between areas
      can be set. Diffraction mode can be used for any area, although it is likely to
      be useful only for the Search area. If diffraction is used, the camera length
      and diffraction focus are stored as parameters.</P>
    <P><i>Special Features in Low Dose Mode.</i>&nbsp; In low dose mode, numerous features of SerialEM operate differently.    <UL>
      <LI>
        Tasks that use lower magnification tracking (e.g., 
        finding eucentricity and resetting image shifts) will generally use View images, 
        although some have menu entries to control which area is used.&nbsp; However, 
        each such task has a required minimum field of view when run outside of low 
        dose, which sets a minimum magnification at which it should be run.&nbsp; When 
        the View magnification is higher than that minimum, and the Search magnification 
        is lower than View and not in LM mode, the program will use Search instead to 
        minimize the risk of excessive shifts between images.&nbsp; This means that you 
        do not need to set up View to provide an adequate field of view for all tasks, if 
        you have set up Search as a suitable alternative.&nbsp; See the
        <a href="menu_settings.htm#hid_specializedoptions_tasksuseviewevenifsearchbetter">Tasks Use View Even if Search Better</a>
        command for more details.
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Autoalignment operates with two autoalign buffers. A Record or Preview image
        will be aligned to the image in the first autoalign buffer, whereas a Trial or
        Focus image will be aligned to the second autoalign buffer. The 'Align to'
        button in the <A HREF="hidd_alignfocus.htm">Image Alignment &amp; Focus control
          panel</A> will indicate which are the two autoalign buffers.</LI>
      <LI>
        Autoalignment will work with the beam constricted inside the camera field
        because autoalign will detect dark areas in the corners of the image (namely,
        areas outside the beam) and use only the largest rectangle inside these areas
        for alignment.</LI>
      <LI>
        The Tilt Series Controller uses D and E as the two autoalign buffers. It uses
        images of the Trial area for tracking, but it also maintains a reference image
        from the Record area, so that each new Record image is aligned to that
        reference and then replaces it.</LI>
      <LI>
        If you choose to adjust intensities automatically during a tilt series, only
        the intensity of the Record area will be adjusted.</LI>
      <LI>
          Since the View and Search areas often have very different magnifications from
          each other and from the other areas, display zoom will be remembered separately
          for these two areas.&nbsp; This should make it easier to recognize similar
          features when toggling between images from the different areas.</LI></UL>
    <P><i>Setting Properties of Areas.</i>&nbsp; You can set the properties of a low dose area by making it be the current area
      then adjusting its features. The current area and its beam properties are
      displayed on the second line of the <A HREF="hidd_lowdose.htm">Low Dose control
        panel</A> . There are two ways to set the current area: take an image of
      the area, or select the area with the 'Go to' button in the control panel.&nbsp; You can adjust most
      properties of the current area by turning on the 'Continuous update of mag
      &amp; beam' checkbox. With this option on, any changes in the magnification,
      spot size, condenser lens setting, or energy filter settings will change the
      defined properties of the area.&nbsp; However, beam position is still a global
      feature that applies to all low dose areas, so a change in beam position is not
      recorded with &#39;Continuous update&#39; on.&nbsp; (A relative beam position can be set
      for each area with a separate control.) If the option is
      off, you can change these features temporarily, but the stored properties of
      the area will be reimposed next time a picture is taken of the area.</P>
    <P>If you want to make initial adjustments to the properties of an area with no
      exposure of the specimen at all, then select the area with a 'Go to' button and
      adjust its features.</P>
    <P><i>Setting Positions of Trial/Focus Areas. </i>&nbsp;The positions of the Focus and Trial areas can be set by selecting the Focus or
      Trial radio buttons in the 'Define position of area' box. Once one of these
      buttons is selected, two pieces of information become available at the bottom
      of the <A HREF="hidd_lowdose.htm">Low Dose control panel</A> . One is a text
      box showing the distance along the tilt axis from the Record area to the area
      being defined, where negative and positive numbers reflect opposite directions
      along the axis. The other display shows essentially a safety factor for
      spillover of the beam from the area being defined into the Record area; it is
      the distance between a circle circumscribing the area being defined and the
      edge of the Record area.</P>
    <P>There are several ways to adjust the position of the area being defined. In
      addition to simply typing in a distance in the text box, the most convenient is
      to take a picture of the View area. The position of the area being defined
      relative to the center of the View will be shown by a green cross, and you can
      click with the left mouse button to select a new position. On a View image, the
      Record area and the area being defined will also be shown with a box, with a
      circle circumscribing the area being defined.&nbsp; However, if Focus and Trial 
      are being kept at the same position, the circle will circumscribe the larger of 
      their two acquisition areas. They can be kept together either with the option
      <strong>Keep Focus and Trial identical</strong> option in the <A HREF="hidd_lowdose.htm">Low Dose control
        panel</A> or with the specialized option in the Settings menu, <a href="menu_settings.htm#hid_specializedoptions_keepfocustrialstsameposition">Keep Focus & Trial at Same Position</a>.&nbsp; 
      In the latter case, the magnifications of the two areas are taken into account 
      when picking which area to circumscribe.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Offsets.</i>&nbsp; Several different &quot;offsets&quot; can be set by different
      procedures:</P>
    <ul>
      <li>A defocus offset can be applied when going to the View area in order to
        increase contrast for the View images.&nbsp; The value can be set with a spinner
        in the 'Offsets for View' box of the <A HREF="hidd_lowdose.htm">Low Dose control panel</A>.</li>
      <li>The View area can be centered on the Record area by recording a shift offset
        for the View area.&nbsp; This is done by centering a feature in Record, then
        taking a View image and shifting that feature to the center; see
        <a href="hidd_lowdose.htm#viewShiftOffset">Shift offsets for View and Search</a> for
        details.</li>
      <li>Beam shifts can be imposed to center the beam independently in each area using
        controls in the 'Additional beam shift' box.&nbsp; The procedure is to center
        the beam in the Record area then go to other areas and record the additional
        beam shift required to center the beam by checking and unchecking the 'Set' box.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        See <a href="hidd_lowdose.htm#addedBeamShift">
        Additional beam shift</a> for details.</li>
      <li>Added beam tilts can also be recorded at the same time as the beam shift, if
        this enabled by a property Setting.&nbsp; On a Thermo/FEI scope, one can also impose a dark
        field beam tilt for the Trial and Focus areas, which might be a way to keep the
        beam from being occluded by the objective aperture.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <P><i>Balancing Shifts.</i>&nbsp; The final concept that needs explaining is that of balancing the shifts. On the
      300 KV Tecnai, one should think of the objective aperture as defining a circle
      within which the specimen can be imaged by means of image shift. If the Record
      area is in the middle of this circle, then the Focus and Trial areas will be
      displaced to near the edge of the circle, and there may not be much range of
      image shift left for tracking during the tilt series. Given these limitations,
      it is preferable to arrange the Record and Trial areas so that the center of
      the circle is midway between them, because then neither one will be as close to
      the edge of the usable circle as the Trial area is with the Record area in the
      center. This is accomplished by pressing the 'Balance Shifts' button. The
      change can be undone by pressing the 'Center Unshifted' button, so-called
      because it will recenter the areas that are considered unshifted (Record and
      View).</P>
    <P>Your low dose parameters are saved to your settings file and will be restored
      when you restart SerialEM. If you have never started low dose before, the areas
      are undefined, and they will acquire the current microscope settings when they
      are first activated. Three sets of parameters are stored: one for a non-energy filter camera,
      one for an energy filter camera, and one for STEM.</P>
    <P><B>Steps for Initially Setting up Low Dose</B></P>
    <P>It is somewhat difficult to get low dose set up initially, but following a set
      procedure may be helpful.</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        Before going to low dose mode, set the magnification and beam strength that you
        will want for the View area.</LI>
      <LI>
        Turn on low dose mode and take a picture of the View area.</LI>
      <LI>
        Turn on 'Continuous update' to adjust the View area properties further. Be sure
        to set any View-area-specific energy filter settings.</LI>
      <LI>
        Copy View properties to the Record area with the 'R' button in 'Copy current
        area mag &amp; beam' radio group.</LI>
      <LI>
        Take a Preview or Record picture to go to the Record area, then turn on
        'Continuous update'.</LI>
      <LI>
        Adjust the magnification for the Record area, and any specific filter settings.</LI>
      <LI>
        Adjust the beam strength by taking a Preview or Record and selecting 'Set
        intensity' in the Tasks menu. Enter the desired number of counts in a Record
        image. If there is a big change, this may take 2-3 iterations.</LI>
      <LI>
        If the beam is too small, reduce the spot size; if it is too large (i.e., you
        are concerned about extra exposure to the Trial/Focus areas), then increase the
        spot size.</LI>
      <LI>
        If you want to get the beam to be not much bigger than the camera field of
        view, you need to condense it so that you can see the whole beam, then expand
        by a controlled amount. See step 14.</LI>
      <LI>
        Make sure 'Keep Focus and Trial identical' is selected and copy Record
        properties to the Trial area with the 'T' copy button.</LI>
      <LI>
        Select the radio button to define the position of the Trial area.</LI>
      <LI>
        Take a View picture. Click with the left mouse button to define a position for
        the Trial area. Note the 'Maximum area separation' and click again to get a
        sufficiently positive separation, or just type in a position.</LI>
      <LI>
        Take a Trial picture. Adjust area-specific filter settings (e.g., slit out).</LI>
      <LI>
        Here it is essential to get the beam constricted to just the Trial area and
        centered on it. You can do this either by adjusting brightness and position
        blindly or by using the 'Set Intensity' and 'Move Beam' operations in the Tasks
        menu. When using 'Set Intensity', note that changing intensity by a certain
        factor should change beam diameter by the square root of that factor. Also note
        that your changes will not be accurate when the beam does not fill the camera
        field. In general, the procedure is:</LI></OL>
    <UL>
      <LI>
        Constrict the beam enough so that you can see enough of its edge to be able to
        center it.</LI>
      <LI>
        Change spot size if necessary to get close to the desired intensity.</LI>
      <LI>
        Center the beam.</LI>
      <LI>
        Expand the beam until it just circumscribes the area.</LI></UL>
    <P>If you are restarting with some existing parameters, you would not do all of
      these steps. You would probably take a View and adjust its properties if
      necessary (steps 2 and 3), take a Record and adjust its properties (steps 5-9),
      then adjust the Trial/Focus area (steps 11-14).</P>
    <P><strong>Montaging in Low Dose Mode</strong></P>
    <P>In low dose mode, montaging (acquisition of overlapping images) is most 
      commonly used to obtain low or medium magnification maps in the Navigator for 
      finding and marking areas to be acquired; however, it is also possible to 
      acquire higher-magnification montages with the Record area.&nbsp;&nbsp; If low 
      dose mode is on when the <A href="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup dialog box</A> 
      is opened, the montage is dedicated to being taken in low dose mode and the 
      dialog enables a set of radio buttons for choosing which low dose area to use, 
      and which camera parameters to use when montaging with the Record area.&nbsp; In 
      the latter case, either Mont-Map or Preview parameters can be used instead of 
      having to modify the Record parameters.&nbsp; In addition, montages can be taken 
      with the Multiple Record routine, which can compensate for the effects of image 
      shift on beam tilt; however, these montages have several other special features 
      listed in the help for the <A href="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup dialog box</A>.</P>
