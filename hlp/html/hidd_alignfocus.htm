      <P><B>Align to</B></P>
      <P>This button will align the image in buffer A to the image in the indicated 
        buffer, using cross-correlation. The buffer holding the image being aligned to 
        is called the autoalign buffer. This buffer is determined as follows:</P>
      <P>When not in low dose mode, images will be aligned to the first buffer after the 
        rolling buffers, unless the 'Align to B instead of to...' button in the <A HREF="hidd_buffercontrol.htm">
          Buffer Control panel</A> is selected, in which B is the autoalign buffer.</P>
      <P>When in low dose mode, there are actually two autoalign buffers: the first for 
        images from the Record area, the second for images from the Trial or Focus 
        area. These are the first and second buffers after the rolling buffers. 
        However, if the 'Align to B instead of to...' button is selected, images of all 
        types will simply be aligned to the image in B.</P>
      <P><B>Autofocus</B></P>
      <P>When not in Low Mag mode, this button will run the autofocus routine to measure 
        specimen defocus (based on the amount of image displacement when the beam is 
        tilted) then change the defocus to your chosen target value. In Low Mag mode, 
        the button will simply set the focus to the standard focus for the current 
        magnification.</P>
      <P><B>Clear Alignment</B></P>
      <P>This button will set the alignment shift of the image in the currently displayed 
        buffer to zero. If this is buffer A, then microscope image shift will also be 
        changed by an amount corresponding to the image alignment shift. Thus, this 
        button can be used to undo a bad autoalignment.</P>
      <P><B>Reset Image Shift</B></P>
      <P>This button will reset the microscope image shift to zero and move the stage to 
        compensate for the change in image shift. If the specimen is tilted, defocus 
        will also be changed to compensate for the change in Z height of the feature in 
        the center of the field.</P>
      <P>Because of inaccuracies in stage movement, image features can end up 0.5 micron 
        or more from their original positions. This button is useful for a quick reset 
        when you are still moving around on the specimen. If you want to keep a feature 
        of interest centered through the reset, then select the <A HREF="menu_tasks.htm#hidc_reset_realign">
          Reset &amp; Realign command</A> in the Tasks menu.</P>
      <P><B>Move Stage for Big Mouse Shifts</B></P>
      <P>When this check box is selected, moving the image in Buffer A with the right 
        mouse button will result in the stage being moved by the corresponding amount, 
        provided that the move is bigger than a threshold that can be adjusted with the 
        'Set Threshold Shift' button. Moves less than the threshold amount will cause 
        the usual image shift instead. If you hold down the Shift key while shifting 
        with the right mouse button, the stage will be moved regardless of the size of 
        the move.</P>
      <P><B>Set Threshold Shift</B></P>
      <P>Use this button to set the thresholds for moving the stage instead of shifting 
        the image with the right mouse button. First you will be asked to enter a 
        relative threshold, expressed as a fraction of the size of the camera field. 
        Then you will enter an absolute threshold in microns.</P>
    <P><b>Correct Backlash in Stage Moves</b></P>
    <P>When this check box is selected, backlash correction will be applied in stage 
      movements initiated with the mouse and when resetting image shift.&nbsp; This 
      should result in more consistent shifts in actual position when there is 
      substantial backlash in the stage, particularly when reversing directions.&nbsp; 
      If the stage is known to be in a backlash corrected state, then the movement 
      will typically be done in two steps so that the final position is approached 
      from the same direction as previously.&nbsp; The two steps are not needed when 
      the movement is already the right direction.&nbsp; If the stage is not in a 
      backlash corrected state, the backlash correction used in montaging at the 
      current magnification will be applied.</P>
      <P><B>Center Image Shift on Tilt Axis</B></P>
      <P>When this check box is selected, SerialEM will move the origin for image shift 
        laterally from the optic axis to the tilt axis. Resetting image shift will then 
        set the image shift to a position on the tilt axis, and the IS readout in the 
        Microscope Status panel will be 0.0 even though image shift is nonzero (as can 
        be seen in the microscope interface). With this option enabled, lateral movement 
        and focus changes will be minimized during a tilt series. However, turning the 
        option on or off will misalign the objective aperture on the 300 KV Tecnai or Polara. 
        When the option is selected, the program will move the image shift origin when 
        it is started and reset the origin when it exits.</P>
      <P><B>Adjust Image Shift between Mags</B></P>
      <P>This check box will be enabled if the image shift offsets between magnifications 
        have been calibrated. When it is selected, these offsets will be applied 
        whenever you or the program changes magnification, and features should stay 
        centered despite misalignments between magnifications. This can be particularly 
        useful when going between LM and normal magnifications. Just as for the 'Center 
        Image Shift on Tilt Axis' option, the IS readout in the Microscope Status panel 
        will not reflect these offsets. Using this option may be disadvantageous in 
        situations where image shift is limited by the objective aperture or by 
        intrinsic limitations, since an unknown part of the image shift range may be 
        consumed by the offsets.</P>
      <P>Even when this option is off, the Navigator will use the calibrated offsets 
        wherever appropriate to make features marked at one magnification appear to be 
        at the same stage coordinates at another magnification. Thus, while calibration 
        of the offsets is necessary for optimal performance of the Navigator, the use 
        of this option is more of a convenience than a necessity.</P>
      <P><B>Trim Dark Borders in Autoalign</B></P>
      <P>When this check box is selected, SerialEM will always analyze each image being 
        correlated in an autoalign and exclude dark regions that appear to be outside 
        the area of the beam. Even when the option is not selected, this analysis is 
        done in low dose mode, when performing tasks at lower magnification, and in the 
        first round of the Realign to Item routine (where it is also useful for 
        excluding grid bars).&nbsp; The Tasks menu command&nbsp;
        <a href="menu_tasks.htm#hid_special_disable_dark_trim_in_align">Disable Dark 
        Trim in Align</a> can be used prevent this automatic trimming operation in 
        selected cases.</P>
      <P><B>Set Autoalign Trim Fraction</B></P>
      <P>Use this button to set the fraction to trim off each edge of the images that are 
        being aligned. For example, with a fraction of 0.1, 100 pixels will be trimmed 
        off each side of a 1K x 1K image. In rare cases, the default value of 0.04 will 
        not be adequate and a larger fraction is needed to exclude peripheral parts of 
        the image with strong contrast. Because this is needed so rarely, this value is 
        not stored in the settings file between SerialEM sessions.</P>
