    <P>This dialog opens when you want to import a map image from a source other than 
      the microscope, such as a light microscope. This dialog allows the following 
      entries:</P>
    <P><B>Section number</B></P>
    <P>This entry is essential if the file has multiple sections. Sections are numbered 
      from 0; the label on this text box will indicate the range of section numbers.</P>
    <P><B>Stage position</B></P>
    <P>Enter the stage position if you are going to import more than one image from the 
      same source and want to use registration points on multiple images to establish 
      the transformation between these maps and maps taken in the EM.
    </P>
    <P><B>Registration number</B></P>
    <P>This control allows you to select a registration number, as long as it is 
      different from the registration number of any non-imported items. If you are 
      importing more than one image from the same source, you would probably want 
      them to have the same registration number.</P>
    <P><B>Stage to Image transformation</B></P>
    <P>This control allows you to select a transformation that relates stage 
      coordinates in the light microscope to image coordinates, if any have been 
      defined in the properties file. Having a correct transformation is important if 
      you are using multiple imported images. Then transformation would allow points 
      marked anywhere in the images to be assigned approximately correct stage 
      coordinates.</P>
    <P><B>Make color overlay with current map item</B></P>
    <P>This checkbox is enabled if the current Navigator item is an imported map with 
      the same size as the image now being imported. If you select it, then the 
      program will combine the previous image with the new one to make a color 
      overlay, with the colors determined by your entry in the <B>Images to use for red, 
        green, blue</B> text box. This box requires 3 digits to be entered, one for 
      each of the three colors. The digits must be 1 to use the current map item, 2 
      to use the newly imported item, or 0 to use nothing for that color. For 
      example, 120 will show the previous image in red and the new one in green; 121 
      will show the previous in magenta and the new one in green. The program will 
      read in each image, copy one to buffer A, then combine them just as for the <A HREF="menu_process.htm#hid_process_makecoloroverlay">
        Make Color Overlay command</A> command in the Process menu. The complete 
      list of color possibilities for the previous and new image are:</P>
    <P>120&nbsp; Red - Green<BR>
      102&nbsp; Red - Blue<BR>
      210&nbsp; Green - Red<BR>
      201&nbsp; Blue - Red<BR>
      122&nbsp; Red - Cyan<BR>
      211&nbsp; Cyan - Red<BR>
      212&nbsp; Green - Magenta<BR>
      121&nbsp; Magenta - Green<BR>
      112&nbsp; Yellow - Blue<BR>
      221&nbsp; Blue - Yellow<BR>
      012&nbsp; Green - Blue<BR>
      021&nbsp; Blue - Green<BR>
