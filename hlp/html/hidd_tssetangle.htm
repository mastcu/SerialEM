    <P>After the series of high tilt images are acquired by the tilt range finding 
      procedure, the stack of images will be resized to nearly the whole available 
      area, and this small set of buttons will appear at the top. Use PageUp and 
      PageDown keys to find and display the image at the last usable tilt angle at 
      one side of the tilt series. Then press <B>Use as Angle Limit</B>. If series 
      were taken for both negative and positive angles, step to the last good image 
      on the plus side and the press <B>Use as Angle Limit</B> again. When you next 
      open the <A HREF="hidd_tiltseries.htm">Tilt Series Setup dialog</A> it will 
      import the angle limits that you selected. If you select only one limit, it 
      will import only that limit. Also, if you run the Range Finding procedure 
      again, for example, to repeat the negative series, and then select one new 
      angle limit from that series, a limit that you selected on the previous run for 
      the positive angles will still be available when you open the <A HREF="hidd_tiltseries.htm">
        Tilt Series Setup dialog</A> .</P>
    <P>After selecting angles, you should close this dialog. You can choose to retain 
      the image stack, or you can have it closed to free up memory. Press <B>Close</B>
      to close the dialog and the stack, or <B>Close &amp; Keep Stack</B> to close 
      the dialog but keep the stack open.</P>
