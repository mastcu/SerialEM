        Tuning Parameters Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog allows you to set parameters 
      that are used when taking images for routines that do CTF fitting, namely, when 
      calibrating and correcting astigmatism, correcting coma, and taking a Zemlin 
      tableau.&nbsp; By default, Record parameters are used for these images.&nbsp; 
      The upper part of the dialog lets you change the Record parameters in specific 
      ways.&nbsp; The bottom of the dialog has options governing how the routines 
      initially determine and modify focus.</p>
    <p><strong>Set exposure to X sec</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option and enter an exposure time to use in place of the one in 
      Record parameters.</p>
    <p><strong>Set drift settling to X sec</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option and enter a drift settling time to use for the images.</p>
    <p><strong>Set binning to N</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option and enter a binning to use for the images.&nbsp; The CTF 
      analysis itself should be fairly insensitive to binning unless it is too high, 
      but you may want to use a binning higher than 1 to make the Thon rings extend 
      farther out in the display. The program will find the nearest available binning.&nbsp; 
      For K2/K3 cameras, the program will use a binning of at least 1 if this option 
      is not selected.</p>
    <p><strong>Use full-field images, not current subarea</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option to use the full camera area regardless of any subarea set in 
      Record perameters; this will generally give the most signal for CTF fitting.</p>
    <p><strong>Align frames with N frames</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option to use frame alignment with the Framealign module in 
      SerialEM or the SEMCCD plugin to DigitalMicrograph if the camera supports taking 
      frames, and enter the number of frames to acquire.&nbsp; If this option is off, 
      frame alignment will not be done, regardless of the setting in Record 
      parameters.</p>
    <p><strong>Align with parameter set N</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option to use a specific frame alignment parameter set instead of 
      whatever is specified in Record parameters, and enter the position of the set in 
      the table in the&nbsp; <a href="hidd_framealign.htm">Frame Alignment
      Parameters dialog</a> (numbered from 1).</p>
    <p><strong>Find initial defocus with Focus area in Low Dose mode</strong></p>
    <p>For the astigmatism and coma operations, the program needs to know what the 
      defocus is so that it can set the fitting range correcting for the CTF routines. 
      If necessary, it will measure defocus using beam-tilted images as usual.&nbsp; 
      By default, it does this on-axis with Record images when in Low Dose mode, to 
      give the most accuracy by measuring at the same location where CTF will be 
      measured.&nbsp; Select this option to use the Focus area instead, if you are 
      trying to minimize dose at the current location.</p>
    <p><strong>Smallest defocus allowed for correcting astigmatism</strong></p>
    <p>The program will make the defocus more negative, if necessary, to have a 
      minimum amount of underfocus when measuring or correcting astigmatism.&nbsp; 
      Enter a minimum value here; the default is -0.9 micron and a value as small as 
      -0.1 micron is allowed.</p>
    <p><strong>Amount to increase underfocus when calibrating astigmatism or measuring 
      coma</strong></p>
    <p>Astigmatism calibration and coma measurement require a larger defocus to allow 
      for the astigmatism in the beam-tilted images.&nbsp; This entry specifes the 
      increase in underfocus; the default is 0.5 micron and a value as small as 0.2 is 
      allowed.</p>
