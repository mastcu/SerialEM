    <P>This panel shows detailed information about the image buffer currently shown in 
      the main display window, and summary information about several other buffers. 
      For an ordinary image acquired by the user, the summary line for a buffer will 
      show what parameter set was used to acquire the image and whether it is saved 
      to file or not. Other descriptive terms will appear when the program has 
      acquired an image for calibration or tracking, when an image has been 
      processed, or when the image was composed by the montage acquisition routine.</P>
    <P><B>Current buffer spin button</B></P>
    <P>This control can be used to navigate through the image buffers. The up arrow 
      will advance to higher buffers (equivalent to pressing the PageDn key) and the 
      down arrow will move back toward the A buffer (the same as pressing PageUp).</P>
    <P><B>Current buffer details</B></P>
    <P>Below the summary line for the current buffer will appear the image size in 
      pixels, the binning used to acquire the image, the tilt angle, the X and Y 
      stage positions, and the microscope defocus setting. If the image is one piece 
      of a montage, the piece number will be substituted for the X and Y stage 
      positions.</P>
    <P><B>Additional buffer summaries</B></P>
    <P>Up to three additional buffer contents are described, starting from the first 
      buffer and skipping the current buffer.</P>
