          Automatically</FONT></B></P>
    <P>Multiple tilt series can be run in a batch mode by using the Navigator to define 
      positions where the series are to be taken, setting the parameters for the 
      acquisition in advance as the positions are selected for tilt series in the 
      Navigator, then starting the tilt series from the <A HREF="hidd_navacquire.htm">Navigator 
        Acquire dialog box</A> .
    </P>
    <P><B><I>Points to consider:</I></B> There are various considerations for using 
      this capability:</P>
    <UL>
      <LI>
        <i>Maps.</i>
        Each target position should be located within a medium-magnification Navigator 
        map that is large enough to allow the position to be found reliably with the <A HREF="menu_navigator.htm#hid_navigator_aligntoitem">
          Realign to Item command</A>. Such a map is referred to as an anchor map, 
        and Navigator has features to simplify taking such maps. It is recommended that 
        you also take a map at the magnification for the tilt series, and corresponding 
        to a zero-degree view of the target area, as this map will allow more precise 
        positioning, but this map is not essential.</LI>
      <LI>
        <i>Beam centering.</i>&nbsp;
        You will probably want to use the beam autocentering task to protect against 
        the beam position wandering during protracted data collection. To do so, you 
        need to set up the task to work properly at the magnification where you are 
        acquiring data, using the <A HREF="hidd_autocensetup.htm">Beam Autocenter Setup 
          dialog box</A> . Once this is set up, you should test the task before data 
        collection to see if its parameters need adjustment (run the <A HREF="menu_tasks.htm#hid_tasks_autocenterbeam">
          Autocenter Beam</A> command in the Tasks menu or use the Shift-E hot key).</LI>
      <LI>
        <i>Cooking plastic sections.</i>&nbsp;
        If you are working with plastic sections, you can make the pre-exposure of the 
        specimen be part of the batch operations. To do so, you need to set up the 
        specimen cooking task using the <A HREF="hidd_cooksetup.htm">Specimen Cooking Setup 
          dialog box</A> . Once this is set up, you can run that dialog to check the 
        parameters before data collection and make sure that they are appropriate for 
        the extent of area being acquired.</LI>
      <LI>
        <i>Bidirectional series.</i>&nbsp; For reliable results, it may be necessary to 
        take the tilt series in two directions from 0 tilt.&nbsp; This will usually be 
        the case with cryo-samples, where the walk-up to a high starting angle or 
        tracking down from it may fail.&nbsp; It may also be desirable to use a 
        bidirectional series with other samples where there is difficulty focusing at 
        high tilt, since it is generally easier to stay in focus as high tilt is 
        approached in small steps from below than to establish good focus when starting 
        the series at high tilt.</LI>
      <LI>
        <i>Finding tilt range.</i>&nbsp;
        Often you need to set the tilt angle range separately for the individual tilt 
        series, after assessing what range is feasible at each location. You may find 
        the <A HREF="hidd_tsrange.htm">Tilt Series Range Finder</A> helpful for 
        assessing the tilt range. If you use it and then select angles at the end of 
        the range in the <A HREF="hidd_tssetangle.htm">Tilt Series Range Viewing dialog</A>, 
        then you need to open the relevant tilt series parameters (using the TS 
        Parameters button in the Navigator) to have the selected angles become the 
        limiting angles for that series.&nbsp; Note that as of SerialEM 3.4.0, a batch 
        tilt series is considered to be successful if an image that is too dim is 
        encountered at a high enough angle, as specified by settings in the <A HREF="hidd_tspolicies.htm">Tilt 
          Series Batch Policies dialog</A>. Thus, you may be able to skip assessing the 
        ending angle.&nbsp; Since the same criteria are applied to terminate the first 
        part of a bidirectional series upon a dim image, you may be able to skip 
        assessing the tilt range completely for such series.</LI>
      <LI>
        <i>Eucentricity and Z height</i>.&nbsp;
        As always, the tilt series will run much more smoothly if the eucentric height 
        is set for the specific location. Moreover, if the specimen is going to be 
        pre-exposed, then the final eucentricity setting should be done after cooking. 
        This can be achieved by selecting to refine eucentricity either in the <A HREF="hidd_navacquire.htm">
          Navigator Acquire dialog box</A> or the Tilt Series Setup dialog. However, 
        this routine cannot run reliably unless the Z height is within ~10 microns of 
        eucentric. There are two options for taking care of this: select the Rough 
        Eucentricity task in the <A HREF="hidd_navacquire.htm">Navigator Acquire dialog box</A>, 
        or set the eucentricity approximately by whatever means you prefer when you set 
        up the series at each point. If you set the Z height after adding the Navigator 
        item that is marked for a tilt series, select the item and change its Z height 
        with the <b>Update Z</b> button in the Navigator.</LI>
      <LI>
        <i>Error handling.</i>&nbsp;
        You need to make a basic choice of what should happen in case of an error: 
        whether the tilt series should stop with a message or whether the Navigator 
        should terminate it and go on to the next. The <A HREF="hidd_tspolicies.htm">Tilt 
          Series Batch Policies dialog</A> has an option for this basic choice and 
        some other options relevant to running tilt series or other automated 
        operations. These include an option to have a separate log file for each 
        series, and an option to control whether and when to close column/gun valves if 
        a message box is open for a long time.</LI>
      <LI>
        <i>Email messages.</i>&nbsp;
        Receiving email notification can be very helpful when running multiple series, 
        especially if you select for a message box come up when there is an error. In such 
        cases, an email will be sent before the box is opened. To send mail, the 
        program needs to be able to contact an SMTP server and this server needs to be 
        defined in the properties file. Once this has been configured, you will be able 
        to enter an email address in the Tilt Series menu and select the option to have 
        emails sent.</LI>
      <LI>
        <i>Imaging states.</i>&nbsp;
        For each tilt series, you have the option to store an imaging state consisting 
        of scope settings such as beam intensity (or, in Low Dose mode, the entire set 
        of parameters for the record area), and Record parameters such as exposure 
        time. In Low Dose mode, the axis position of the Focus area and an offset from 
        center of a subarea selected in the Focus camera parameters is also stored.&nbsp; This capability is obviously useful if you want a different state for 
        some tilt series, or a different Focus area in Low Dose mode; it can also be used for the first tilt series to guarantee 
        that a particular state is set then.</LI></UL>
    <P><B><I>Stopping and intervening:</I></B> When running tilt series from the 
      Navigator, it is still possible to intervene manually, but the situation is 
      somewhat complex because of the two layers of control involved. There are three 
      distinct phases where the <b>End</b> and <b>STOP</b> buttons in the Camera and Script control 
      panel have three different effects.</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        During the actions run by the Navigator prior to the start of the tilt series, 
        such as rough eucentricity, the <b>STOP</b> button will stop the action and stop the 
        Navigator. The current item will still be marked for tilt series acquisition, 
        and you can resume from the <A HREF="hidd_navacquire.htm">Navigator Acquire dialog 
          box</A> . The <b>End</b> button (labeled <b>End Nav</b>) will signal the Navigator to end 
        after this tilt series is finished.</LI>
      <LI>
        During the startup phase of the tilt series, before the first image of the 
        series is acquired, the <b>STOP</b> button will end the current operation and put the 
        TSC into a 'postponed' state. When resumed from this state, the TSC will go 
        through the whole sequence of startup operations again. Pushing the <b>Resume</b> 
        button will open the <A HREF="hidd_tiltseries.htm">Tilt Series Setup dialog box</A>
        , from which you can restart the series. Alternatively, you can abandon this 
        location and go on to the next tilt series by terminating the series, either 
        from the Tilt Series menu or by pushing the <b>End</b> button (now labeled <b>End TS</b>). 
        If you want to end all acquisitions, then select &#39;End Acquire' in the Navigator 
        Menu BEFORE terminating the tilt series. During the startup phase, pressing the 
        <b>End</b> button (labeled <b>End Loop</b>) will cause the TSC to stop after the saving the 
        first image of the series.</LI>
      <LI>
        Once the tilt series is through the startup phase, <b>STOP</b> stops the current 
        operation and <b>End</b> (labeled <b>End Loop</b>) stops it at the end of a loop. At this 
        point everything works as in a manually started tilt series. The <b>Resume</b> and 
        <b>Back Up</b> buttons function as usual, opening their respective dialogs. The <A HREF="hidd_tiltseries.htm">
          Tilt Series Setup dialog box</A> can be opened to adjust parameters and 
        resume from there. The tilt series can be terminated from the Tilt Series menu 
        or with the <b>End</b> button (labeled <b>End TS</b>). Again, if you want to end all 
        acquisitions, first select 'End Acquire' in the Navigator Menu.</LI></OL>
    <P><B><I>Step-by-step Procedures:</I></B> There a several ways to use the various 
      tools provided for setting up multiple tilt series; here is one variation.</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        Make whatever maps are needed to locate your areas of interest. This could be 
        just a low-mag map, or a low-mag map plus a series of medium-mag maps. The 
        steps below for making anchor maps would not be needed if all points are 
        located in medium-mag maps.</LI>
      <LI>
        Open a file for maps of the areas to be acquired.</LI>
      <LI>
        Locate the first area of interest. Run the Rough Eucentricity procedure or 
        otherwise adjust the Z height to be approximately the eucentric height.</LI>
      <LI>
        Go to the magnification required for the tilt series and acquire an image of 
        exactly the area to be imaged.</LI>
      <LI>
        Save this image and make it a map.</LI>
      <LI>
        Go to a magnification where the camera field of view is 10-15 &micro;m (if you have a 
        state set up for this in the Imaging State dialog, set this state there).</LI>
      <LI>
        Acquire an image and save it as a map.</LI>
      <LI>
        Check 'For anchor state' in the Navigator dialog.</LI>
      <LI>
        Return to the working magnification (use 'Restore Prior State' in the Imaging 
        State dialog).</LI>
      <LI>
        Run the Tilt Series Range Finding procedure or otherwise determine the limits 
        of the series.</LI>
      <LI>
        Select the first map again and check 'Tilt series' in the Navigator.</LI>
      <LI>
        Define file properties as needed then define tilt series properties.</LI>
      <LI>
        Go to the next area of interest, and adjust the eucentric height approximately 
        if necessary.</LI>
      <LI>
        Acquire an image of the area to be acquired.</LI>
      <LI>
        Press the <B>Anchor Map </B>button. This will save the first image as a map and 
        make a second map for an anchor.</LI>
      <LI>
        Determine the angular range for the series.</LI>
      <LI>
        Select the higher mag map again if necessary and check 'Tilt series'. This time 
        no dialogs will open.</LI>
      <LI>
        Press the <B>TS Parameters</B> button to import an angular range determined 
        with the Range Finder and to adjust any other parameters</LI>
      <LI>
        To adjust the automatically generated filename, press the <B>Filename</B> button.</LI>
      <LI>
        Continue with steps 13 to 19 for any other areas to be acquired.</LI>
      <LI>
        Check that beam autocentering is working correctly, if you plan to use it.</LI>
      <LI>
        If appropriate, check the parameters for specimen cooking.</LI>
      <LI>
        Select 'Acquire at Points' from the Navigator menu. Tilt series acquisition 
        will be selected as the action to perform.</LI>
      <LI>
        Select 'Autocenter beam' if you are set up to use it; 
        &#39;Realign to Item&#39; to align to the maps at each position; 'Cook specimen' if 
        appropriate; and 'Fine Eucentricity if this operation is not selected in the 
        tilt series parameters for each series</LI>
      <LI>
        Set 'Close valves at end' and 'Send email' as desired, then press the <B>GO</B> 
        button.</LI></OL>
    <P>The order of the steps can be varied. If you adjust eucentric height after 
      making a map item, you can press the <B>Update Z</B> button in the Navigator to 
      change the Z value of the map item. If you run the Range Finding procedure 
      after setting other tilt series parameters, press <B>TS parameters </B>to get 
      the new angular limits into the tilt series parameters.</P>
    <P>If you are acquiring montaged tilt series, you may want to make the map at the 
      working magnification be a montage of the same size, although this is not 
      essential. In this case, you would have two files for the maps, one for these 
      montages and one for the anchor maps. A procedure for doing this would be as 
      follows:</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        Open a montage file for the maps at the working magnification.</LI>
      <LI>
        Locate the first area for acquisition.</LI>
      <LI>
        Press <B>Prescan</B> in the Montage Control panel to take a trial montage 
        rapidly.</LI>
      <LI>
        Shift the prescan with the right mouse button and take another if necessary.</LI>
      <LI>
        Take a full montage and make it a map.</LI>
      <LI>
        Open another file for single frame images.</LI>
      <LI>
        Go to a magnification appropriate for taking an anchor map.</LI>
      <LI>
        Take an image and save it as a map. Mark this item 'For anchor maps'.</LI>
      <LI>
        Return to the working magnification.</LI>
      <LI>
        Select the montage file to be the current file, or just close the second, 
        single-image file.</LI>
      <LI>
        Perform other tasks for setting up a tilt series at this location, as above</LI>
      <LI>
        Locate the next area for acquisition.</LI>
      <LI>
        Use <B>Prescan</B> to localize the desired area, then take a full montage.</LI>
      <LI>
        Press <B>Anchor Map</B>.</LI>
      <LI>
        Perform other tasks for setting up a tilt series at this location.</LI>
      <LI>
        Repeat steps 13 to 15 for further areas to be acquired.</LI></OL>
    <P>Note that the <B>Anchor Map</B> button becomes particularly convenient when maps 
      are kept in multiple files.</P>
