        first encounter the <a href="hidd_fileproperties.htm">File Properties dialog</a> 
        (unless the option to skip this dialog is selected), then the standard <A HREF="afx_hidd_filesave.htm">
          Save As dialog box</A>. If the file already exists, you will be asked to 
        confirm that you want to replace it.&nbsp; If you are saving to an MRC file, the 
        extension .mrc will be added automatically unless you put the extension on 
        yourself, use an extension known to the system, or use the extension &#39;.st&#39; or 
        &#39;.map&#39;.&nbsp; (In other words, if you enter &#39;file.st&#39; it will not make the name 
        be &#39;file.st.mrc&#39;.)</P>
      <P>You do not need to open a file before saving; if you choose the save command 
        before a file is open you will go through the same sequences of steps to open a 
        file.</P>
      <P>You can use this command to open a new image file even if another file is 
        already open. Up to 8 files can be opened.&nbsp; The newly opened file becomes the current file for reading and 
        writing. The current file can be selected with the combo box in the <A HREF="hidd_buffercontrol.htm">
          Buffer Control Panel</A>. The names of open files are always displayed 
        in the program's title bar, with the current file name enclosed in brackets.</P>
      <P>You can open an existing image file for reading and writing with the <A HREF="#hidm_file_openold">

        with the image in Buffer A. You will be prompted to enter the number of the 
        section that you wish to overwrite; the default value offered to you is the 
        number of the last section in the file. Sections are numbered from 0.</P>
      <P>If you are montaging and need to overwrite a section, you will need to change

        However, if a montage was partially acquired with stage movement and the 
        program can resume it, then you can use this command (which appears as

        an open file, to indicate that the file is different from the open file.&nbsp; 
        The selection of file properties are stored separately for files opened through 
        this command and files opened in other ways.&nbsp; The type of file to store, 
        and the TIFF compression type, are saved between sessions.&nbsp; For example, if 
        you choose to store single images as TIFF with JPEG compression, and then select 
        a different compression for saving as a series of TIFFs, single images would 
        still be saved as TIFF-JPEG without having to reselect that in the properties 
        dialog.</P>

      <P>Use this command to modify the truncation of the data when saving images as 
        bytes. When one chooses to save bytes, then SerialEM can avoid compressing the 
        dynamic range of the data by truncating the values of a relatively few pixels. 
        The number of pixels to truncate at the black and white end of the range is 
        initially specified in the File Properties dialog, but can be changed 
        thereafter with this command. Using this command sets the values for the 
        current open file and the default for newly opened files but does not affect 
        any other open files.</P>

      <P>Use this command to modify the way that data from a 16-bit camera will be 
        treated when they are saved as integers in a signed data file. You will be 
        asked to enter 0 to truncate the data at 32,767, which could give saturated 
        images; 1 to divide the data by 2, which will discard probably useless 
        precision; or 2 to subtract 32768, which will preserve the data in its entirety 
        at the expense of having negative numbers. If a file is reopened, this is the 
        way to set the treatment of the data to be different from the default. Using 
        this command sets the policy for the current open file and the default for 
        newly opened files but does not affect any other open files.</P>

      <P>Use this command to modify the way that signed data are saved to a file that is 
        in unsigned 16-bit integer mode. By default positive values are saved without 
        modification, and negative values are truncated at zero. Enter 1 to have 32768 
        added before values are saved, which will preserve negative values. Using this

        dialog opens when opening a new file.&nbsp; With the option selected, the dialog 
        will open only the first time during a session of the program. Thereafter, the

      <P>Use this command to read an image from a file. If there is a currently open

        remain open after reading from it. Also, in that case the file can be a TIFF or

      <P>Unless there is only a single section in the file, you will be asked to enter 
        the section number to read; the default value offered to you is the number of 
        the last section in the file. Sections are numbered from 0.</P>
      <P>If you are reading from the currently open file and there is more than one 
        section in it, the <A HREF="hidd_readfiledlg.htm">Read Current File dialog box</A>

      <P>Use this command to read an image from a file other than the currently open 
        image file. You will enter the <A HREF="afx_hidd_fileopen.htm">File Open dialog box</A>
        to select a file. The file can be a TIFF or DigitalMicrograph (dm3) file as 
        well as an MRC file. Then, unless there is only a single section in the file, 
        you will be asked to enter the section number to read; the default value 
        offered to you is the number of the last section in the file. Sections are 
        numbered from 0.</P>
      <P>The image will be read into the buffer selected in the <A HREF="hidd_buffercontrol.htm">

        SerialEM will read the entire section and leave a binned-down overview in 
        Buffer B and a full-scale image of the center of the area in Buffer A. It is 
        possible to read from a montaged file even if montaging is currently activated 
        with a different file open.</P>

      <P>After specifying the section, you will be asked to enter the number of the piece 
        in X and Y; pieces are numbered from 1. The image will be read into the buffer

        The information will be virtually identical to that saved in the .mdoc file 
        associated with an image file.&nbsp; This .mdoc file allows one to preserve 
        information about saved frames without having to save the summed image in 
        SerialEM into a file.&nbsp; The file will be opened every time new data are 
        saved and closed again after saving, so it is always up to date.&nbsp; By 
        setting the general property &#39;FrameMdocForFalcon&#39;, it is also possible to save
