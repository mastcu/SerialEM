        Dialog</span></p>
    <p>In the &quot;Shift to Marker&quot; operation, a Navigator point is added at a feature on 
      an image, then the feature is found in an image at some higher magnification, 
      and the green marker point is placed on the feature.&nbsp; The program can then 
      compute the amount that the Navigator item's stage position needs to be shifted 
      so that it corresponds to feature's position at the higher magnification.&nbsp; 
      In the simplest (and original) use of this operation, the coordinates of all 
      Navigator points are shifted.&nbsp; This kind of global shift is appropriate 
      when a single low magnification map is taken and needs to be shifted to give 
      correct positions at a medium magnification, or when the grid position has been 
      perturbed without rotation, so that a global shift is sufficient to restore 
      Navigator positions. However, the greater flexibility provided here is needed to 
      be able to use the procedure conveniently at multiple magnifications or when 
      maps to be shifted do not all exist at once.</p>
    <p>The first set of choices are whether to apply the measured shift to all maps at 
      the registration of the image with the marker point, or to ones only at one 
      magnification.&nbsp; The latter approach is useful when you want to shift the 
      coordinates of medium-magnification maps so that high magnification targets come 
      out centered, without shifting an already-corrected low-magnification map.&nbsp; 
      This is important if you need to pick more positions on the low-magnification 
      map.&nbsp; Whenever shifts are applied to Navigator items just at one 
      magnification, 
      the program keeps track of which maps are shifted by assigning them a common 
      &quot;shift cohort&quot; ID, and it also shifts points and polygons that have been drawn 
      on those maps.</p>
    <p>The second set of choices determine whether the measured shift is saved for 
      reuse with the Apply Saved Shift command.&nbsp; Saved shifts are useful if maps 
      being shifted at a particular magnification are not all available at once.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Newly obtained maps can be easily shifted by the same amount as previous ones by 
      using a saved shift.</p>
    <p><strong>Which items to shift</strong></p>
    <p><em>All items at the  registration of the image with marker point</em>: This is the original 
      behavior, before this dialog existed.&nbsp; With this option, the only way to 
      control which items are shifted is by changing the registration.</p>
    <p><em>All maps at Yx and items marked on them</em>: The magnification shown in 
      place of <em>Y</em> is 
      that of the current item (if it is a map) or of the map on which it was drawn.&nbsp; 
      This option is appropriate if you wish to protect already-shifted items at other 
      magnifications from being shifted, and if it acceptable to shift all maps at the 
      magnification in question.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The third option will appear as:<br />
      
      <em>Only maps at Yx and marked items that have not been shifted 
      before</em> if the map that the current item was marked on has not been shifted previously, or as:<br />
      <em>Only maps at Yx and marked items that were shifted along with the map that the current item was marked on</em> if that map has been shifted. 
      </p>
    <p>The first variant is useful if you are applying the shift routine from scratch 
      to a newly acquired set of maps.&nbsp; The second variant is useful if you use 
      the Apply Saved Shift command for an initial shift of new maps, then use Shift 
      to Marker to refine that shift.&nbsp; In either case, maps will be shifted 
      regardless of whether there are any points marked on them.&nbsp; The process of 
      including items to shift involves three levels of association:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>For current item =&gt; include map it was marked on </li>
      <li>For marked map =&gt; include collection of maps shifted at same time or similarly 
        not shifted </li>
      <li>For each map in collection =&gt; include every point marked on the map. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Saving shifts for reuse</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;<em>Do not save shift for reuse</em>: existing saved shifts, if any, will 
      not be affected.</p>
    <p><em>Save shift to apply again from Yx to Zx or other higher mag</em>: The first 
      magnification value is that of the map the current item was marked on; the 
      second one is that of the image with the marker point.&nbsp; If a shift is 
      already saved for this pair of magnifications, it will be replaced; otherwise a 
      new one will be saved.</p>
    <p><em>Add to saved shift from Xx to Yx:</em> This option will modify the 
      indicated shift and is useful if you wish to refine a saved shift after using it 
      so that it might be more accurate on another new set of maps.&nbsp; The text <em>
      (non-matching higher mag)</em> appears if the current higher magnification is 
      not the same as the one when that shift was saved.&nbsp; Adding to a shift in 
      that case would be appropriate if the two higher magnifications are 
      well-aligned.</p>
