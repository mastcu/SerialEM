      </TABLE>
      <BR>
      <P><A NAME="about_settings"></A><B>About Settings Files</B></P>
      <P>Settings files are used to store just about every parameter that can be set by 
        you in SerialEM. The main exceptions are program states such as Montaging, Low 
        Dose mode, and Tilt Series mode, which need to be activated by you each time 
        you run the program. By default, SerialEM will remember all of your parameters 
        from one session to the next in a file called SerialEMsettings.txt in the 
        directory where SerialEM was started. One can use the options in this menu to 
        save settings into other files and retrieve settings from such files. The menu 
        displays a list of recently used settings files so that you can switch between 
        settings rapidly if necessary.&nbsp; It is also possible to set up a desktop 
        shortcut that makes SerialEM start with a different settings file from the 
        default; see <a href="setting_up_serialem.htm#shortcutsArgs">Shortcuts, Command Line Arguments, and Administrator mode</a>.</P>
    <P>After parameters are read from a file, that file is left open, which has three 
        implications: 1) Settings can be saved to that file via the entry in this menu; 
        2) Settings can be restored from the file to the value that they had when they 
        were last saved there; and 3) When you quit the program, settings will be saved 
        into that file. To prevent settings from being saved into a file when you quit 
        the program, just Close the file or use <a href="#hid_settings_discardonexit">Discard on Exit</a>.</P>
      <P>If your settings become too far from usable, you can restore them to default 
        values by reading from a file called the System Default Settings file.</P>
      <P>Scripts are not stored in settings files, as of SerialEM 3.8. 
        Instead, they are stored in a separate file referred to as a script package 
        file, and the settings file just has an entry with the name of the script 
        package.&nbsp; When you read a settings file, that script file will also be read 
        and become the current script package file, which will be rewritten when the 
        settings are saved.&nbsp; If you read in a new settings file that loads a 
        different script package, the scripts in the package file will replace the respective ones in the program, 
        but any other scripts that you have defined will be lost (another change in 
        behavior on 12/23/19).&nbsp; </P>
    <P>Storing scripts separately makes it possible for multiple settings files to 
      share the same script package, thus preventing diverging versions of the scripts 
      in different files.&nbsp; This will happen as a matter of course when you save a 
      new settings file specialized for some conditions.&nbsp; If you already have 
      multiple settings files from before this change and you want them to share the 
      same script package, first decide which one&#39;s package should be the one that is 
      shared.&nbsp; It is recommended that you open that settings file first and use
      <a href="menu_script.htm#hid_script_savepackageas">Save Package As</a> in the 
      Scripts menu to save it to a name that indicates its status as the master 
      package.&nbsp; Then open other settings files and use
      <a href="menu_script.htm#hid_script_loadnewpackage">Load New Package</a> in the 
      Scripts menu to load that package.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_settings_open"></A><B>Open command (Settings menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to open a file in which settings were stored previously. 
        Ordinarily, your default settings file is open whenever you are running 
        SerialEM. Thus, opening a new file will usually involve closing that file. If 
        this is the case, you will be asked whether you want to save your current 
        settings into the currently open file before closing it and opening a different 
        one.</P>
      <P>You will enter the <A HREF="afx_hidd_fileopen.htm">File Open dialog box</A> to 
        select the file, which is a text file.
      </P>
      <P>Below the Open menu entry is a list of the most recently used settings files. 
        Select one of these files to open it. In this case, the settings will 
        automatically be saved to the current file first, without requiring your 
        confirmation. To prevent this, you could close the current settings file first.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_settings_readagain"></A><B>Read Again command (Settings menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to read parameter values from the currently open settings file. 
        You would do this if you do not want to keep any parameter changes that you 
        have made and want to restore your settings to the state saved in this file.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_settings_save"></A><B>Save command (Settings menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to save settings to a file. If there is a settings file open, 
        then the program state will be saved to this file. If not, you will enter the <A HREF="afx_hidd_filesave.htm">
          Save As dialog box</A> to specify a new file to save values into. A file 
        that has been saved into is left open; in other words, it will be saved to 
        again when the program exits, unless you close it first.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_settings_saveas"></A><B>Save As command (Settings menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to save settings to a file different from the one that is 
        currently open. You will enter the <A HREF="afx_hidd_filesave.htm">Save As dialog 
          box</A> to specify a file to save values into. Any previously open settings 
        file will be closed, and the new one will be left open. This means that it will 
        be saved to again when the program exits, unless you close it first.&nbsp; The 
        new settings file will use the same script package file as the old one unless 
        you save the script package to a different name.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_settings_close"></A><B>Close command (Settings menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to close a settings file. This means that it will not be saved 
        to when the program exits, which you might want to do if you are going to 
        experiment with parameters that you will not want to save. You will be asked 
        whether you want to save your current settings to the file before closing it.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_settings_discardonexit"></A><B>Discard on Exit command (Settings menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command works like closing the file except that the program will not ask 
        if you want to save settings first, and it will not ask if you want to save 
        settings on exit or when loading new settings.&nbsp; It is useful when settings 
        have reached a state that you do not want saved.&nbsp; It will prevent 
        autosaving as well.&nbsp; The selection will be toggled off again by reading or 
        writing settings, and it does not persist from one run of the program to the 
        next.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_settings_readdefaults"></A><B>Read Defaults command (Settings menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to read the System Defaults settings file. If there is a 
        settings file currently open, you will be asked whether you want to save your 
        settings to that file before overlaying them with the system defaults.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_settings_autosave"></A><B>Autosave command (Settings menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to control whether settings will be saved to a file 
        periodically (every 5 minutes, except during a tilt series). Autosaving is 
        useful if you are doing things that present a risk of crashing the program. If 
        no settings file is open when Autosave is on, then nothing will be saved.</P>
       <P><A NAME="hid_miscellaneousoptions_reversewheelzoomdirection"></A><B>Reverse Wheel Zoom 
         Direction command (Settings - Specialized &amp; Misc. Options submenu)</B></P>
      <p>Use this command to toggle whether moving the mouse wheel away from you zooms 
        the image down (the default) or up (the behavior when the option is selected).</p>
     <p>
     <A NAME="hid_specializedoptions_closevalvesafterlonginactivity"></A><B>Turn Off Beam After Long Inactivity command (Settings - Specialized &amp; Misc. Options submenu)</B></p>
      <p>With this option, you can enable the program to close valves or turn off the
        filament if it is left idle for longer than a specified length of time.&nbsp;
        After selecting the option, enter the number of minutes of inactivity after
        which the program should turn off the beam, or 0 to disable this feature.&nbsp; 
        Inactivity means no operations like running scripts, taking images, or other 
        higher-level operations have occurred; simply accessing a menu item or pressing 
        a button does not count as activity.&nbsp;
        The option appears checked in the menu when a positive time has been entered.&nbsp; 
        On a JEOL with the property &#39;AllowStopEmissionIfIdle&#39; set, a second entry box 
        will come up allowing you to set the number of minutes after which the emission 
        should be turned.&nbsp; The menu item will be checked if either of these entries 
        are non-zero.</p>
      <p><A NAME="hid_specializedmisc_setthresholdforright"></A><B>Set Threshold for 
              Right-dbl-click 2nd shot (Settings - Specialized &amp; Misc. Options submenu)</B></p>
      <p>Use this option to set the threshold fraction of the image field lost before a 
        second image is taken after you double-click in an image with the right mouse 
        button, causing the program to do a stage move to reach that position, take an 
        image, and align it to image clicked in.&nbsp; If hte fraction of image area no 
        longer visiable after the shift exceeds the fraction set here, a second image is 
        taken so that you can see the full area.</p>
     <p>
      <a name="hid_misc_no_true_size"><B>Set Type of Beam Circles 
            in LD Define</a> (Settings - Specialized &amp; Misc. Options submenu)</B></p>
      <p>When beam sizes are available either as illuminated areas on a Titan or from a 
        beam size Use this option to select which kind of beam circles to show on a Low 
        Dose View image when defining the positions of Focus or Trial areas.&nbsp; A box 
        will pop up with three choices:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The classic display with a solid circle circumscribing the camera field of 
        view for the area being defined.</li>
      <li>Dashed circles representing the estimated beam size for both the area being 
        defined and the Record area, provided that a beam size is available in the 
        current conditions.</li>
      <li>Both the circumscribing circles and the dashed circles representing the &quot;true&quot; beam 
        sizes.</li>
    </ol>
      <A NAME="hid_special_disable_dark_trim_in_align"></A><B>Disable Dark Trim in
      Align command (Settings - Specialized &amp; Misc. Options submenu)</B></p>
    <p>
      Even when 'Trim dark borders in Autoalign' is not selected in the
      <a href="hidd_alignfocus.htm">Image
      Alignment &amp; Focus</a> control panel, this trimming happens automatically in 
      three cases: when in Low Dose mode, when doing a task at a lower magnification 
      and not in Low Dose mode, and in the first two rounds of Realign to Item or alignments after resetting image shift 
      in Align to Template.&nbsp; This option allows the automatic
      trimming to be disabled in selected cases.&nbsp; Three dialog boxes will come
      up.&nbsp; The first controls the trimming in Low Dose mode; enter 1 if you want
      to disable it just when doing a tilt series, or 2 if you want to disable it
      always.&nbsp; The second entry controls the trimming when doing tasks; again,
      enter 1 if you want to disable it just when doing a tilt series, or 2 if you
      want to disable it always.&nbsp; The third entry allows you to disable the
      trimming when running Realign to Item or Align to Template - this is the same 
      option that can be set in the <a href="hidd_navrealign.htm">Navigator Align 
      Setup</a> dialog.&nbsp; Note that the &#39;AlignTo&#39; script
      command also has an optional entry to prevent trimming.&nbsp; The decision to
      trim is made as follows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trimming is not done if &#39;AlignTo&#39; is run with that option set to prevent
        trimming</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if doing Realign to Item or Align to Template, trimming is 
        determined by the option set here for those operations</li>
      <li>Or, if in low mag for another task and not in Low Dose, trimming is determined
        by the option set here for tasks</li>
      <li>Or if in Low Dose mode, not doing a Realign or&nbsp; Template Align, trimming is determined by the
        option set here for Low Dose</li>
      <li>If not in Low Dose mode or doing Realign or Template Align or a task, trimming is controlled by
        the choice in the control panel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <A NAME="hid_specialoptions_adjustfocusonprobemodechange"></A><B>Adjust Focus on Probe Mode Change command (Tasks - Special Option submenu)</B></p>
    <p>
      When changing between microprobe and nanoprobe TEM modes on Thermo/FEI scopes, the
      scope will restore the defocus last seen in a mode when returning to that mode.&nbsp;
      With this option turned on, the program will try to maintain a constant
      difference between the focus levels in the two modes. It does this by tracking
      how much defocus changes during the time spent in one mode and imposing that
      focus change on the scope's restored focus value when switching to the other
      mode.&nbsp; This means that you can use autofocus in one mode and have the
      required focus change applied when returning to the other mode.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>
      The option needs to be turned off in order to impose a needed focus difference
      between the modes.&nbsp; As of SerialEM 3.7, focus differences are always
      applied in Low Dose mode only when this option is on. </p>
    <p>
      If you want to &quot;Reset Defocus&quot; while this option is on and have that change in
      focus readout ignored, use the entry in the Focus menu instead of a button in
      the microscope interface.</p>
    <p>
      <A NAME="hid_specialoptions_normalizealllens"></A><B>Normalize All on Mag Change command (Settings - Specialized &amp; Misc. Options submenu)</B></p>
    <p>This option controls when all lenses are normalized after changing
      magnification on a Thermo/FEI or Hitachi scope.&nbsp; Normally, the program will
      always normalize the projector lenses, and normalize condenser and objective
      lenses in addition when changing between LM and nonLM magnifications.&nbsp; With
      this option, you can enter a 1 to normalize all lenses after all mag changes
      within LM, or a 2 to normalize all lenses after all mag changes.</p>
    <p>
      <A NAME="hid_specialoptions_normalizeviaviewforau"></A><B>Normalize Via View

      When this option is selected, the program will switch to the View area in Low
      Dose before going to the Focus area for autofocusing, unless it is currently in
      Focus and arrived there from View.&nbsp; When &#39;Keep Focus and Trial identical&#39;
      is selected in the Low Dose Control Panel, Trial and Focus are considered
      equivalent for the purpose of deciding whether this normalization needs to be
      done.</p>
     <A NAME="hid_specializedoptions_skipblankinginldwithscreenup"></A><B>Skip Blanking in LD when Screen Up command (Settings - Specialized &amp; Misc. Options submenu)</B><p> This option controls whether the beam is kept blanked except when acquiring images when the
       screen is up in Low Dose mode.
       &nbsp; This blanking protects the specimen from being exposed when there is no camera
       inserted that would cause shuttering to keep the beam blanked.  When there is a camera inserted,
        it also protects the specimen when the screen is lowered during the interval between the
       camera opening its shutter and SerialEM discovering that the screen is down.&nbsp; Select this option to
       prevent the blanking if it is problematic for some reason.

        command (Settings - Specialized &amp; Misc. Options submenu)</B></p>
    <P>When using a phase plate on a JEOL microscope, the beam shift that accompanies
      every image shift operation will change the centering of the phase plate.&nbsp;
      Turn on this entry to suppress the beam shift for the alignment operations
      involving image shift during a tilt series.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_special_piezo_for_ld_axis_shift"></A><B>Piezo for LD Axis Shift
        command (Settings - Specialized &amp; Misc. Options submenu)</B></P>
    <p>
      If there is a piezo plugin loaded that can provide stage movement along the tilt
      axis, and the properties file contains both an entry 'UsePiezoForLDAxis'
      specifying this piezo and an entry 'PiezoScale' defining the range and scaling
      of this piezo, this option can be turned on to use this piezo movement as a
      substitute for on-axis image shift between Record/View and Trial/Focus areas in
      Low Dose mode.&nbsp; The option can be toggled only when Low Dose mode is off.&nbsp;
      When Low Dose is turned on with this option enabled, the piezo is moved to the
      end of its range appropriate for the Record area.&nbsp; Several restrictions are
      also enforced: Focus and Trial are constrained to the same properties; 'Balance
      Shifts' is turned off; rotation of the interarea axis away from the tilt axis is
      turned off.&nbsp; The 'Position on tilt axis' entry can be negative or positive
      as needed, but the stage will be moved to the other end of its range when the
      sign is changed.</p>

    <p>
      Ordinarily, the program will acquire images in single-frame mode for almost all
      automated operations, even when using a camera parameter set that has continuous
      mode set.&nbsp; If this option is selected, images acquired directly by the Tilt
      Series Controller will be allowed to be taken in continuous mode if that mode is
      set in the camera parameters.&nbsp; Such continuous acquisitions must be stopped
      manually by the user before the tilt series can go on.&nbsp; This exception does
      not apply to images taken when autofocusing or doing other tasks; all tasks
      enforce single-frame mode.&nbsp; Thus, it applies to Trial and Record, as well
      as to View and Preview images taken in Low Dose mode.</p>

      <P>Use this command to set the address(es) to which emails from SerialEM will be 
        sent. You can enter more than one address, separated by commas or spaces. The 
        address entered here will be used for any emails sent from SerialEM; i.e., ones 
        sent by the Navigator or a script as well as ones after a tilt series stops.</P>

    <P>Use this command to set the value of one program property.&nbsp; The command 
      can be used with nearly all of the general (non-camera-specific) properties that 
      contain just a single numeric entry and can be set by name in 
      SerialEMproperties.txt.&nbsp; First enter the full name of the property as 
      listed in the properties file or the help file (but matching to this entry is 
      case-insensitive, so case does not matter).&nbsp; If this does not match one of 
      the properties that can be set, an error message is given.&nbsp; Otherwise, 
      another dialog box opens for entering the property value.&nbsp; The existing 
      value of the property is shown in the box.</P>

        defined in a file with a list of the desired elements, either a file 
        SEMbasicModeItems.txt in the system directory with the properties file, or a 
        file specified with the property 'BasicModeDisableHideFile'.&nbsp; See
