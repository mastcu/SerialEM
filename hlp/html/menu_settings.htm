      </TABLE>
      <BR>
      <P><A NAME="about_settings"></A><B>About Settings Files</B></P>
      <P>Settings files are used to store just about every parameter that can be set by 
        you in SerialEM. The main exceptions are program states such as Montaging, Low 
        Dose mode, and Tilt Series mode, which need to be activated by you each time 
        you run the program. By default, SerialEM will remember all of your parameters 
        from one session to the next in a file called SerialEMsettings.txt in the 
        directory where SerialEM was started. One can use the options in this menu to 
        save settings into other files and retrieve settings from such files. The menu 
        displays a list of recently used settings files so that you can switch between 
        settings rapidly if necessary.</P>
      <P>After parameters are read from a file, that file is left open, which has three 
        implications: 1) Settings can be saved to that file via the entry in this menu; 
        2) Settings can be restored from the file to the value that they had when they 
        were last saved there; and 3) When you quit the program, settings will be saved 
        into that file. To prevent settings from being saved into a file when you quit 
        the program, just Close the file.</P>
      <P>If your settings become too far from usable, you can restore them to default 
        values by reading from a file called the System Default Settings file.</P>
      <P>Scripts are also stored in settings files. When you read a file that contains 
        scripts, the scripts in the file will replace the respective ones in the program, 
        but any other scripts that you have defined will be retained.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_settings_open"></A><B>Open command (Settings menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to open a file in which settings were stored previously. 
        Ordinarily, your default settings file is open whenever you are running 
        SerialEM. Thus, opening a new file will usually involve closing that file. If 
        this is the case, you will be asked whether you want to save your current 
        settings into the currently open file before closing it and opening a different 
        one.</P>
      <P>You will enter the <A HREF="afx_hidd_fileopen.htm">File Open dialog box</A> to 
        select the file, which is a text file.
      </P>
      <P>Below the Open menu entry is a list of the most recently used settings files. 
        Select one of these files to open it. In this case, the settings will 
        automatically be saved to the current file first, without requiring your 
        confirmation. To prevent this, you could close the current settings file first.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_settings_readagain"></A><B>Read Again command (Settings menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to read parameter values from the currently open settings file. 
        You would do this if you do not want to keep any parameter changes that you 
        have made and want to restore your settings to the state saved in this file.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_settings_save"></A><B>Save command (Settings menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to save settings to a file. If there is a settings file open, 
        then the program state will be saved to this file. If not, you will enter the <A HREF="afx_hidd_filesave.htm">
          Save As dialog box</A> to specify a new file to save values into. A file 
        that has been saved into is left open; in other words, it will be saved to 
        again when the program exits, unless you close it first.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_settings_saveas"></A><B>Save As command (Settings menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to save settings to a file different from the one that is 
        currently open. You will enter the <A HREF="afx_hidd_filesave.htm">Save As dialog 
          box</A> to specify a file to save values into. Any previously open settings 
        file will be closed, and the new one will be left open. This means that it will 
        be saved to again when the program exits, unless you close it first.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_settings_close"></A><B>Close command (Settings menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to close a settings file. This means that it will not be saved 
        to when the program exits, which you might want to do if you are going to 
        experiment with parameters that you will not want to save. You will be asked 
        whether you want to save your current settings to the file before closing it.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_settings_readdefaults"></A><B>Read Defaults command (Settings menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to read the System Defaults settings file. If there is a 
        settings file currently open, you will be asked whether you want to save your 
        settings to that file before overlaying them with the system defaults.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_settings_autosave"></A><B>Autosave command (Settings menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to control whether settings will be saved to a file 
        periodically (every 5 minutes, except during a tilt series). Autosaving is 
        useful if you are doing things that present a risk of crashing the program. If 
        no settings file is open when Autosave is on, then nothing will be saved.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_settings_setaproperty"></A><B>Set a property command (Settings menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to set the value of one program property.&nbsp; The command 
      can be used with nearly all of the general (non-camera-specific) properties that 
      contain just a single numeric entry and can be set by name in 
      SerialEMproperties.txt.&nbsp; First enter the full name of the property as 
      listed in the properties file or the help file (but matching to this entry is 
      case-insensitive, so case does not matter).&nbsp; If this does not match one of 
      the properties that can be set, an error message is given.&nbsp; Otherwise, 
      another dialog box opens for entering the property value.&nbsp; The existing 
      value of the property is NOT shown in the box, just a 0.</P>
