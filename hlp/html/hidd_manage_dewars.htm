        Dialog</span></p>
    <p> This dialog allows management of the various events that can occur
      periodically on the microscope and interfere with stable imaging during
      acquisition: the running of vacuum pumps and the filling of nitrogen dewars.&nbsp;
      (In order for the latter options to show up on non-Krios Thermo/FEI scopes, a 
      property entry is needed; see below). In some cases, the program can only check whether an event has started and then
      wait for it to finish; in others it can initiate an event periodically.&nbsp; It
      is used to set parameters only; the selected operations are performed when the
      scope management routine is run either from the 'DewarsAndPumps' script command
      or by an action during Navigator acquisition.&nbsp; That routine can be run
      frequently (i.e., on every acquisition item) because the actual times between
      operations are all governed by the intervals set here.&nbsp; The operations are
      run through the same mechanism as when run by the 'LongOperation' script
      command, so timing is based on the same times when each operation was last run
      that are kept track of when running through script and stored in the short-term
      calibrations file between program sessions. </p>
    <p> For Thermo/FEI scopes, the situation when using the UTAPI interface is very 
      different from that with the old scripting interface.&nbsp; With UTAPI, there is 
      no direct control of filling or of the autoloader turbo pump; instead there is a 
      &#39;Vibration Manager&#39; that informs about whether the system is vibrating and can 
      be directed to avoid vibrations and to prepare to avoid vibrations.&nbsp; 
      Preparing to avoid vibrations seems to be the only reliable way to end up with 
      the system reporting that it is not vibrating, so that call is used in the 
      various cases covered by this dialog.</p>
    <p> &nbsp;</p>
    <p> <em><strong>Vacuum Management</strong></em></p>
    <p>The top section of the dialog currently appears only for Thermo/FEI scopes.</p>
    <p><strong>Check for PVP running and wait until done</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option to have the program check whether the PVP is running and
      pause acquisition until it has stopped.</p>
    <p><strong>Run buffer cycle every N minutes</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option to run the regular buffer cycle periodically, and fill in
      the text box with the number of minutes between runs (an integer).</p>
    <p><strong>Run autoloader buffer cycle every N minutes&nbsp; (non-UTAPI only)</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option to run the autoloader buffer cycle periodically, and fill in
      the text box with the number of minutes between runs (an integer).&nbsp; Whether
      this option appears is governed by the first bit (1) of the property
      'DewarVacCapabilities', which is on by default for a Krios but must be explicitly
      provided for other scopes with autoloaders.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em><strong>Nitrogen Management&nbsp; (non-UTAPI)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Vibration Avoidance and&nbsp; Nitrogen Management&nbsp; (UTAPI)</strong></em></p>
    <p>The bottom section of the dialog appears if there is any way to control or
      monitor an automatic nitrogen filling system.&nbsp; For Thermo/FEI scopes, this is
      determined by the second bit (2) of the 'DewarVacCapabilities' property, which
      again is on by default for Krios.&nbsp; For JEOL scopes, it is determined by the
      'JeolHasNitrogenClass' property, and both the transfer tank and the stage tank
      are treated together.&nbsp; For either type of scope, the section will also
      appear if the 'HasSimpleOrigin' property is set, and commands to the Simple
      Origin filling system will be used.</p>
    <p><strong>Refill nitrogen every N hours&nbsp; (non-UTAPI)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Prepare to avoid every N hours&nbsp; (UTAPI)</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option to refill dewars periodically and fill in the text box with
      the interval between filling in hours (a floating point entry is allowed).&nbsp;
      When the management routine is run with this option selected, the program will
      first check whether filling has already started.</p>
    <p><strong>Check for ongoing filling and wait until done&nbsp; (non-UTAPI)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check for ongoing filling or vibrations and wait until done&nbsp; 
      (UTAPI)</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option to check for whether filling has started and wait until it
      is done. Even if filling is specified to be done at an interval, it would be
      advisable to check this option too if there is some chance that it might occur
      spontaneously.</p>
    <p><strong>Pause if time to next refill is below N minutes&nbsp;&nbsp; (non-UTAPI 
      only)</strong></p>
    <p>This line and the next one appear if SerialEM can determine the time until the
      system plans to start a filling - with Thermo/FEI and Simple Origin but not with JEOL.&nbsp;
      When the program checks for ongoing filling, it also checks the time interval
      until the next filling.&nbsp; If that interval is below the time entered on this
      line (a floating point value), the program will pause and wait for it to start.&nbsp; 
      With UTAPI, it is necessary to start the refill to end up in the desired state, 
      so there is pausing.</p>
    <p><strong>Start the refill if time to next refill is below N minutes&nbsp; 
      (non-UTAPI)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepare to avoid if time to next refill is below N minutes&nbsp; 
      (UTAPI)</strong></p>
    <p>If this option is selected, the program will start the filling immediately&nbsp;when
      the
      interval to the next filling is longer than the time on the previous line but below the time entered
      here (also a floating point value).&nbsp; This option is provided particularly
      for tilt series, where it allows you to minimize wasted time while avoiding
      pauses or disturbances during the acquisition.&nbsp; When using it, a small
      entry like 0.5 would be appropriate for the entry above, and the time here would
      be set longer than the expected acquisition time.</p>
    <p><strong>Time to wait after filling is done</strong></p>
    <p>Enter the interval in minutes to wait after the filling done (a floating point
      value).&nbsp; This wait will occur both when filling is discovered to be ongoing
      and when it is started by the program.</p>
    <p><strong>Repeat checks just before primary action in Acquire at Items</strong></p>
    <p>This option appears at the bottom of the dialog regardless of whether there is
      one section or two.&nbsp; It allows the Navigator to run the management routine
      twice during the acquisition cycle.&nbsp; It can be run first, to minimize the
      chance that a long operation occurs between the initial preparations (e.g.,
      alignment and focusing) and the actual acquisition. Then the Navigator will run
      it again, just prior to acquisition, doing just the checks for ongoing
      operations.&nbsp; The same thing can be accomplished when running from script by
      running &#39;ScopeManagement -1&#39; early on and &#39;ScopeManagement 1&#39; just before
      acquiring.</p>
