        Dialog</span></p>
    <p> This dialog allows management of the various events that can occur 
      periodically on the microscope and interfere with stable imaging during 
      acquisition: the running of vacuum pumps and the filling of nitrogen dewars.&nbsp; 
      In some cases, the program can only check whether an event has started and then 
      wait for it to finish; in others it can initiate an event periodically.&nbsp; It 
      is used to set parameters only; the selected operations are performed when the 
      scope management routine is run either from the 'DewarsAndPumps' script command 
      or by an action during Navigator acquisition.&nbsp; That routine can be run 
      frequently (i.e., on every acquisition item) because the actual times between 
      operations are all governed by the intervals set here.&nbsp; The operations are 
      run through the same mechanism as when run by the 'LongOperation' script 
      command, so timing is based on the same times when each operation was last run 
      that are kept track of when running through script and stored in the short-term 
      calibrations file between program sessions. </p>
    <p> <em><strong>Vacuum Management</strong></em></p>
    <p>The top section of the dialog currently appears only for FEI scopes.</p>
    <p><strong>Check for PVP running and wait until done</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option to have the program check whether the PVP is running and 
      pause acquisition until it has stopped.</p>
    <p><strong>Run buffer cycle every N minutes</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option to run the regular buffer cycle periodically, and fill in 
      the text box with the number of minutes between runs (an integer).</p>
    <p><strong>Run autoloader buffer cycle every N minutes</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option to run the autoloader buffer cycle periodically, and fill in 
      the text box with the number of minutes between runs (an integer).&nbsp; Whether 
      this option appears is governed by the first bit (1) of the property 
      'DewarVacCapabilities', which is on by default for a Krios but must be explicitly 
      provided for other scopes with autoloaders.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Nitrogen Management</strong></em></p>
    <p>The bottom section of the dialog appears if there is any way to control or 
      monitor an automatic nitrogen filling system.&nbsp; For FEI scopes, this is 
      determined by the second bit (2) of the 'DewarVacCapabilities' property, which 
      again is on by default for Krios.&nbsp; For JEOL scopes, it is determined by the 
      'JeolHasNitrogenClass' property, and both the transfer tank and the stage tank 
      are treated together.&nbsp; For either type of scope, the section will also 
      appear if the 'HasSimpleOrigin' property is set, and commands to the Simple 
      Origin filling system will be used.</p>
    <p><strong>Refill nitrogen every N hours</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option to refill dewars periodically and fill in the text box with 
      the interval between filling in hours (a floating point entry is allowed).&nbsp; 
      When the management routine is run with this option selected, the program will 
      first check whether filling has already started.</p>
    <p><strong>Check for ongoing filling and wait until done</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option to check for whether filling has started and wait until it 
      is done. Even if filling is specified to be done at an interval, it would be 
      advisable to check this option too if there is some chance that it might occur 
      spontaneously.</p>
    <p><strong>Pause if time to next refill is below N minutes</strong></p>
    <p>This line and the next one appear if SerialEM can determine the time until the 
      system plans to start a filling - with FEI and Simple Origin but not with JEOL.&nbsp; 
      When the program checks for ongoing filling, it also checks the time interval 
      until the next filling.&nbsp; If that interval is below the time entered on this 
      line (a floating point value), the program will pause and wait for it to start.</p>
    <p><strong>Start the refill if time to next refill is below N minutes</strong></p>
    <p>If this option is selected, the program will start the filling immediately&nbsp;when 
      the 
      interval to the next filling is longer than the time on the previous line but below the time entered 
      here (also a floating point value).&nbsp; This option is provided particularly 
      for tilt series, where it allows you to minimize wasted time while avoiding 
      pauses or disturbances during the acquisition.&nbsp; When using it, a small 
      entry like 0.5 would be appropriate for the entry above, and the time here would 
      be set longer than the expected acquisition time.</p>
    <p><strong>Time to wait after filling is done</strong></p>
    <p>Enter the interval in minutes to wait after the filling done (a floating point 
      value).&nbsp; This wait will occur both when filling is discovered to be ongoing 
      and when it is started by the program.</p>
    <p><strong>Do checks just before primary action in Acquire at Items</strong></p>
    <p>This option appears at the bottom of the dialog regardless of whether there is 
      one section or two.&nbsp; It allows the Navigator to run the management routine 
      twice during the acquisition cycle.&nbsp; It can be run first, to minimize the 
      chance that a long operation occurs between the initial preparations (e.g., 
      alignment and focusing) and the actual acquisition. Then the Navigator will run 
      it again, just prior to acquisition, doing just the checks for ongoing 
      operations.&nbsp; The same thing can be accomplished when running from script by 
      running &#39;ScopeManagement -1&#39; early on and &#39;ScopeManagement 1&#39; just before 
      acquiring.</p>
