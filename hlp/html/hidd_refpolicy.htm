    <P>This dialog box allows you to set options for controlling which gain references 
      are used in various cases where multiple references are available. Multiple 
      references can be useful when the quadrant correction for a 4-port camera is 
      imperfect, or if there or problems with fixed pattern noise in binned images 
      even after adjusting the BinningOffset properties. Between the ability to make 
      references in SerialEM for higher binnings, and the ability to pick between 
      these references and DigitalMicrograph (DM) references for individual binnings, 
      it should be possible to control these problems.</P>
    <P>The default behavior of the program is: 1) If both unbinned and binned by 2 
      SerialEM references exist, then the unbinned reference is used for all odd 
      binnings, and the binned by 2 reference is used for even binnings, but only if 
      it is newer than the unbinned reference. 2) If the DM reference is newer than 
      the SerialEM reference, then the program will ask once whether you wish to use 
      it instead; it will ask this question separately with regard to the unbinned 
      and binned by 2 SerialEM reference.</P>
    <P>Once the 'ExtraGainReference' property is set for a camera, this behavior is 
      modified. For each binning where an extra reference is allowed, the program 
      will use that reference if it exists, regardless of its age. If it does not 
      exist, the program will use the unbinned or binned by 2 reference as just 
      described. If a reference does exist but is older than the DM reference, then 
      it will ask about whether you want to use the DM reference instead, 
      specifically for that binning.</P>
    <P>Note that whenever you leave this dialog by pressing 'OK' instead of 'Cancel', 
      the program re-initializes the gain reference module and it will ask the 
      questions about DM references all over again.</P>
    <P><B>Do not use references with binning higher than 2</B></P>
    <P>With this option selected, the program will not only ignore any existing 
      references for binnings greater than 2, it will also behave the same is if such 
      references were not allowed. It will not ask about using a DM reference 
      specifically for such binnings.</P>
    <P><B>Use binned by 2 reference even if older than unbinned reference</B></P>
    <P>Select this option if you always want to use a binned by 2 reference if 
      available, even if it is older than the unbinned reference. If you find that 
      you generally need a separate reference for binned by 2 and unbinned images, 
      you would use this option to avoid having to keep track of which one was done 
      first.</P>
    <P><B>Choosing DigitalMicrograph instead of SerialEM reference</B></P>
    <P>These choices control the questions about whether to use a DM reference.
    </P>

      <LI>
        The first option represents the default behavior described above; questions are 
        asked only when the DM reference is newer.
      </LI>
      <LI>
        The second option is to have the question asked always, regardless of the 
        relative ages of references. When this option is selected, the program will 
        even ask about using a DM reference in place of a higher binned reference that 
        does not exist. For example, if you set 'ExtraGainReferences' to 4 for a Gatan 
        895 camera, this will enable gain references for binnings 3, 4, 6, and 8. Even 
        if you do not make those references, the program will ask, for each of those 
        binnings, whether you want to use the DM reference instead of deriving a 
        reference from the unbinned or binned by 2 SerialEM reference.</LI>
      <LI>
        The last option is to never be asked about using DM references.</LI></OL>
