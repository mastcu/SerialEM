    <P>SerialEM has many controls and status indicators arranged in a set of control 
      panels to the left of the main image window. Here are the common features of 
      these panels:</P>
    <P>A panel can be open or closed with the +/- button in the upper left corner. When 
      it is closed, you will still see the title and +/- button.</P>
    <P>Many panels are divided into two parts, with the lower part containing less 
      frequently used controls or option settings related to the main purpose of the 
      panel. This lower section can be opened and closed with the +/- button labeled 
      'Options'.</P>
    <P>A panel can be detached from the column of panels and turned into a 
      free-standing window that can be positioned anywhere on the screen by pressing 
      the 'F' button. Once a panel has been floated, it can be docked back into the 
      column by pressing the button again (now labeled 'D').</P>
    <P>The '?' button in the upper right corner will open the help page for the control 
      panel.</P>
    <P>The state of control panels will be saved with your Settings and restored when 
      you restart the program (except the montage panel, which always starts closed).</P>
    <P>When you click the mouse on a control or on the background of a control panel, 
      the panel will almost always restore the keyboard focus to an image display 
      window, so that the program will still respond properly to hotkey input. There 
      are a few pixels where this will not happen: the middle line of spin button 
      controls, the periphery of the brightness/contrast sliders, and the title bar 
      of a floating panel. If SerialEM loses focus and its title bar goes gray, just 
      click in the title bar or in the main image window.</P>
