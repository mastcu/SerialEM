    <P>This dialog box provides options for file storage. The ones at the top have to do with 
      how to treat unsigned 16-bit integer data, produced by 16-bit cameras. 
      The MRC standard used to be that MRC files in integer mode stored data as signed 
      integers, ranging from -32768 to 32767. However, 16-bit cameras have the 
      potential to produce numbers higher than 32767. SerialEM provides five (!) 
      options for dealing with this possibility.</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        Data can be saved in the now-standard unsigned integer mode (mode 6). This mode 
        has been supported in IMOD for many years, but there may still be some MRC file 
        reading software that does not read it.  Unless you know that your data are destined 
        for such software, this is the best option to use.</LI>
      <LI>
        Data can be saved in a signed integer file with truncation at 32767. If the 
        counts in the images to be saved are not expected to be higher than 32767, this 
        should not lose any data.
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Data can be divided by 2 when saved to file. This will keep the data positive 
        (and thus proportional to transmitted electrons through the specimen) but will 
        lose one bit of precision. Since the Gatan 16-bit cameras simply amplify the 
        signal from the CCD chip 4 times as much as the 14-bit cameras, dividing by 2 
        probably just removes one bit of noise, which makes this an acceptable option 
        for current US1000/US4000 cameras.&nbsp; This option should not be used for 
        electron counting data from a direct detector camera.</LI>
      <LI>
        Subtracting 32768 and storing with the signed file mode will preserve the 
        camera values completely, at the cost of producing negative values in the 
        output file.</LI>
      <LI>
        Data can be divided by 2 as soon as they are acquired, by selecting <A HREF="menu_camera.htm#hid_camera_divideby2">
          Divide 16-bit By 2</A> in the Camera menu. They will thus never appear to 
        be unsigned integers, making the options for treatment of 16-bit data 
        irrelevant. If the camera noise level is high enough to make this an acceptable 
        procedure, then it has the additional advantage that it will preserve negative 
        values in gain-normalized images. Such values can occur and be meaningful in 
        images with very low counts if the bias of the camera drifts downwards after 
        taking a dark reference.</LI></OL>
    <P>Independent of these choices of how to treat the numeric values, this box 
      provides five options for the format of the file in which data can be saved.</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        MRC files, which can be processed in IMOD and 
        many other software packages. These files 
        can hold multiple images in a stack, and have both a header for standard 
        information about the file and an extended header in which SerialEM stores 
        a small amount of additional information associated with each image, referred to as metadata.&nbsp; 
        This header is updated after every section saved in case the program crashes; 
        this feature also allows a file to be opened in 3dmod as the file is still being 
        saved to.</LI>
      <LI>HDF files, which can be processed in IMOD and EMAN2.&nbsp; HDF stands for 
        &quot;high performance data format&quot;, which is a misnomer in our context. These files can also 
        hold a stack of images and have several advantages over MRC files:&nbsp;they 
        contain all of the metadata for each image that has to be saved in a separate &#39;.mdoc&#39; 
        file for MRC files (see below); images can be saved with ZIP compression; and 
        the output file can be rapidly re-ordered in place for bidirectional and dose-symmetric series 
        instead of having to copy to a new stack.&nbsp; A disadvantage of these files, 
        aside from their limited portability, is that the time to write the header with 
        all these metadata is significant and increases with the number of sections.&nbsp; 
        SerialEM limits the frequency of header updates so that the time consumed per 
        section written is limited by the property
        <a href="file://about_properties.htm#hdf_update_time">HdfUpdateTimePerSection</a>.&nbsp; 
        The consequence is that not all the saved sections may be available when opening 
        the file with 3dmod during acquisition or after some kinds of program crashes 
        that do not close files properly.</LI>
      <LI>
        TIFF files for single images. This option is available only when saving an 
        image (either when saving if there is no open file, or when using <A HREF="menu_file.htm#hidm_file_saveother">
          Save Single/Save to other</A> in the File menu). The file is closed after 
        writing one image.</LI>
      <LI>
        Series of single-image TIFF files listed in a text file. The text file uses the 
        'autodoc' format from IMOD and is assigned the standard extension '.idoc', 
        which stands for 'image autodoc'. This file will include all of the information 
        about each image that would ordinarily be stored in the extended header of an 
        MRC file plus additional metadata. This autodoc file allows a series of TIFF 
        files to be used interchangeably with an MRC stack: images can be read back by 
        section number or overwritten, the file can be reopened, and montaging can also 
        be done with this file format. These files can also be read as image stacks by 
        virtually all programs in IMOD, as of version 4.10.43.&nbsp; If you are just looking for an easy way to get a 
        series of numbered TIFF files, you can ignore all these features and, when you 
        get to the file chooser, think of it as asking for the root name of the series.</LI>
      <LI>
        JPEG files for single images. This option is available only when saving a 
        non-floating point 
        image (either when saving if there is no open file, or when using <A HREF="menu_file.htm#hidm_file_saveother">
          Save Single/Save to other</A> in the File menu). Data are converted to bytes 
        with truncation of extreme values.&nbsp; The file is closed after 
        writing one image.</LI></OL>
    <P>When saving to an MRC file, the dialog provides another option for saving 
      metadata, into a file in the autodoc format. This file will be given the full 
      name of the image stack plus the extension '.mdoc', which stands for 'metadata 
      autodoc'. When you open or read from an existing MRC file, the program will 
      automatically search for an associated '.mdoc' file and read metadata from the 
      file whenever reading an image, thus restoring more information about the image 
      (e.g., defocus) than would otherwise be available.
    </P>
    <P>Both kinds of autodoc files, image and metadata, contain identical information 
      about each image, described in <a href="file://about_formats.htm#metadata">File 
      Formats and Other Documentation</a>.&nbsp; The files also have information at the top that replicates 
      some of the information that would appear in an MRC header.&nbsp; This includes 
      the &#39;Pixel spacing&#39;, which is the pixel size in Angstroms.&nbsp; The IMOD programs 
      Extracttilts and Extractpieces can extract 
      the same information from either type of file as they can from the extended 
      header of the MRC file.&nbsp; In fact, they will automatically look for 
      information in an associated autodoc file if the values are not found in the 
      extended header. In addition, Newstack and Edmont can transfer information from 
      the autodoc file associated with an input file to a new autodoc for an output 
      file.&nbsp; </P>
    <P>The same metadata are stored in an HDF file in a way that makes transfers 
      between an HDF file and an autodoc file easy.&nbsp; Newstack and Edmont can 
      transfer metadata between HDF files, into an HDF file from an autodoc file, or 
      into an autodoc file from an HDF file.&nbsp; Extracttilts can get tilt angles 
      and other information from an HDF file, Extractpieces can get the piece list out 
      of an HDF file, and Extracttilts can be used to create an autodoc file with a 
      command like:</P>
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extracttilts -attr filename.hdf&nbsp; 
      filename.hdf.mdoc&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
    <P><B>Save images to:</B></P>
    <P>Select whether to save data in an MRC file, an HDF file, a TIFF or JPEG&nbsp; file holding a single image 
      (not always available), or a series of TIFF files listed in an autodoc file, as 
      explained above. When you select the latter option, the file chooser for 
      specifying the file will attach the extension '.idoc' if you type in a root 
      name without an extension. Thus, the autodoc will be named rootname.idoc, and 
      the TIFF files will be named rootnameNNNN.tif, where 'NNNN' is a 4-digit number 
      starting with 0000.&nbsp; Your selection here will be saved in the settings file 
      when saving a single image with the <a href="menu_file.htm#hidm_file_saveother">
      Save Single/Save to Other</a> command in the File menu.</P>
    <P><B>Type of compression in TIFF or HDF file:</B></P>
    <P>Select whether TIFF files will be saved with no compression, the type of 
      compression used in Zip and PNG files, LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) compression, or 
      JPEG compression, or select whether HDF files are saved with ZIP compression. ZIP and LZW are both loss-less compression methods that may not save much space.&nbsp; 
      JPEG compression does lose a small amount of information but can save much more 
      space. Your 
      selection here will be saved in your settings file, and separate values are 
      maintained for saving a single image with the
      <a href="menu_file.htm#hidm_file_saveother">Save Single/Save to Other</a> 
      command versus other situations.&nbsp; In contrast, the default values 
      for most other options in this dialog are controlled by entries in the 
      SerialEMproperties.txt file.&nbsp; </P>
    <P><B>Save non-float data as:</B></P>
    <P>Allows integer data to be saved as bytes or 16-bit integers. If there is a 
      16-bit camera and values are not being divided by 2, or if there are any buffers 
      with unsigned data in them, an option to save in unsigned integer 
      mode is also available.&nbsp; These options are apply only if you are saving 
      a non-floating-point image, because there is no provision yet for conversion of 
      floats to integers or bytes.</P>
    <P><B>When saving 16-bit data:</B></P>
    <P>Controls the treatment of unsigned 16-bit integer data being saved to a signed 
      integer file. The three options are to truncate at 32767, divide by 2, or 
      subtract 32768, as described above.
    </P>
    <P><B>Percentage of pixels to truncate converting to bytes:</B></P>
    <P>Controls the fraction of pixels that will be truncated as black (0) or white (255) 
      when images are scaled to bytes.</P>
    <P>Images are captured as 16-bit integers, and the default is to save them to file 
      in this mode. Images can be saved as bytes (range 0 to 255), but this requires 
      scaling of the intensity values into this limited range. To keep the scaling 
      from being dominated by a few extreme values (e.g., from X-rays), which would 
      compress the dynamic range for the rest of the image data, the program will 
      find a scaling which truncates a certain percentage of extremely dark and light 
      pixels at 0 and 255, respectively. Every image is scaled independently. </P>
    <P>If you 
      select byte storage, saving to a TIFF file with JPEG compression, or saving to a 
      JPEG file, you can control the 
      fraction of pixels that will be 
      truncated with these text boxes.&nbsp; Your entries here will be saved in your 
      settings file, and separate values are maintained for saving a single image with 
      the
      <a href="menu_file.htm#hidm_file_saveother">Save Single/Save to Other</a> 
      command versus other situations.&nbsp; However, if the data are very noisy and 
      the image is large, you may find that the contrast is poor when viewing a 
      zoomed-down image that was saved as bytes, and that increasing these truncation 
      values does not help much.&nbsp; The solution is to reduce the image before 
      saving, using the <a href="menu_process.htm#hid_process_reduceimage">Reduce 
      Image</a> command in the Process menu or the ReduceImage script command.</P>
    <P><B>Save in extended header:</B></P>
    <P>Select whether to save tilt angle, C2 intensity value, stage position, 
      magnification, or dose in the MRC file header. The dose is referred to as 'exposure 
      dose' because it is the dose incurred during the time when the camera is 
      exposed to the beam, excluding any pre-exposure of the specimen. All of these 
      values can be extracted from an MRC file with the IMOD program Extracttilts 
      (use 'extracttilts -h' to see options). Regardless of which items are selected, 
      all of these values and more can be saved in a metadata autodoc file.</P>
    <P><B>Maximum number of sections:</B></P>
    <P>Indicate maximum number of sections that space is needed for.</P>
    <P>The program can store various information for each picture in the 'extended 
      header' of the MRC image file. The check boxes allow you to choose which 
      information is stored; namely tilt angles, the stage position, and 
      magnification. If you are montaging, piece coordinates are automatically stored 
      in the header as well. Because these data are placed in the header, the program 
      needs to know when first opening the file how much space to allocate for it. 
      This is the reason for the text box where you specify 'Maximum number of 
      sections'. The admonition is to be generous because if you run out of header 
      space your only choice is to start a new file.</P>
    <P><B>Save extra information in a '.mdoc' metadata file:</B></P>
    <P>Select this option to have metadata saved in a text file with the name of the 
      image file and extension '.mdoc', as described above. When a montage file is 
      opened and the range of coordinates is too large to store in the extended 
      header, a '.mdoc' file is created automatically.</P>
    <P><b>Skip this dialog (turn skipping off in the File menu):</b></P>
    <P>Select this option to avoid seeing this dialog every time you open a new file.&nbsp; 
      Instead, existing values will be used.&nbsp; With this option selected, the 
      dialog will open once per session of the program.&nbsp; When you want to see 
      this dialog again, you can turn off Skip File Properties Dlg in the File menu.</P>
    <P><B>Cancel:</B></P>
    <P>Cancel file setup (and whatever else is being set up, when this dialog is one 
      in a sequence, such as when montaging).</P>
