        <P>The Direct Electron control panel appears when a Direct Electron camera is 
          included in the list of available cameras.&nbsp; Most of the controls here apply 
          only to the direct detector cameras, not the LC1100 lens-coupled camera.&nbsp; 
          In order for a direct detector camera to be accessed, the Direct Electron Camera 
          Server must be running before SerialEM is started.&nbsp; </P>

        <p>
           <b>Name</b></p>
        <p>
            The name of the currently selected Direct Electron camera.&nbsp; The possibilities include 
            the DE12 or DE20, the survey sensor for the 
            DE12 or DE20, and the LC1100.&nbsp; This field will update when you 
            select different Direct Electron cameras.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Detector (C)</b></p>
        <p>
            The current temperature of the camera.&nbsp; Normally for the camera to be 
            properly cooled it must be in the -30 to -60 degree Celcius range.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Setpoint (C)</b></p>
    <p>
            The temperature to which the camera will be cooled when cooling is turned on.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Water line (C)</b></p>
        <p>
            The temperature of the water being used to cool the camera.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Cool camera</b></p>
        <p>
            This box will be checked if the camera is being cooled.&nbsp; Check it to turn 
            cooling on, or uncheck it to warm the camera.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Camera inserted</b></p>
        <p>
            This box will be checked if the camera is inserted or is not retractable.&nbsp; 
            It can be used to insert or retract the camera, but SerialEM does manage 
            insertion and retraction when needed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            <b>Auto save directory</b></p>
        <p>
            This line shows the directory on the Direct Electron server computer where in 
            frames will be saved when autosaving is selected. </p>
        <p>
            <b>File format </b></p>
    <p>
            Use this box to select the file format in which autosaved frames will be stored; 
            the choices are TIFF and HDF.&nbsp; This is a personal setting saved between 
            sessions.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Frames/sec</b></p>
        <p>
            This text box shows the rate at which frames will be read out from the camera 
            and allows you to set the rate to a level up to the maximum, shown to the right 
            of the box.&nbsp; Frame rates are kept track of separately for the direct 
            detector and the survey sensor.&nbsp; They are settings that are saved between 
            sessions.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Protection cover delay</b></p>
        <p>
            The text box shows the delay after opening the protection cover, which is 
            initially set to a value that will keep vibrations from affecting images.&nbsp; 
            You can change this delay, but it will not be saved as a SerialEM setting 
            between sessions.&nbsp; If there is an entry for the delay in the SerialEM 
            properties file, that value will reappear when the program is restarted; 
            otherwise, the delay value will persist in the Direct Electron Server between 
            SerialEM sessions.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Protection cover mode</b></p>
        <p>
            The combo box provides two choices for the protection cover: open between all 
            exposures, or opened and closed for each exposure that is not part of a task or 
            tilt series.&nbsp; For extensive exploratory imaging, you may want to choose to 
            leave the cover open.&nbsp; Leaving the cover open all the time is not safe if a 
            Gatan camera needs to be inserted to have the beam blanked properly.&nbsp; If 
            you change the choice here, it is not saved between sessions of SerialEM.</p>
