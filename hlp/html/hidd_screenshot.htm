        Snapshot Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog, opened from the Window menu, allows you take snapshots of the active image window, including the 
      scale bar and other features such as Navigator items drawn on there.&nbsp; The 
      image can be saved at the same size as it is displayed or scaled up to be saved 
      at higher resolution.&nbsp; Snapshots can be saved to TIFF files with various 
      kinds of compression, or to JPEG files.&nbsp; The snapshot is done by creating a 
      buffer of the size needed to contain the scaled image, drawing into that buffer, 
      and saving the buffer.&nbsp; This can potentially take too much memory when 
      drawing a large montage at 1:1 zoom.&nbsp; Only the image area is drawn, not the 
      purple background that shows up when an image is smaller than the window.&nbsp; 
      By default, the pixel size will be saved as TIFF resolution information in dots 
      per inch and will usually be detected correctly as a pixel size in IMOD.&nbsp; 
      However, this might be problematic when opening files in other software such as 
      Photoshop.&nbsp; The property 'AddDPItoSnapshots' can be set to 0 to prevent the 
      pixel size from being stored, or to a specific value greater than 1 (e.g., 300) 
      to set the resolution to that DPI value.&nbsp; This property can be set with the 
      script command 'SetProperty'.</p>
    <p><strong>Active window</strong></p>
    <p>This line shows the name of the current active image window.&nbsp; Click on the 
      desired window to activate it.</p>
    <p><strong>Image scaling</strong></p>
    <p>Select <strong>No scaling</strong> to have the image saved with no scaling, 
      with the same number of pixels in the file as screen pixels.&nbsp; If the image, 
      with its current zoom, is bigger than the window, only the region showing in the 
      window is saved.</p>
    <p>Select <strong>Scale by</strong> and a particular scaling to have the image 
      scaled up to a higher resolution and larger size than the display in the window.&nbsp; 
      Again, only the region of the image showing in the window is saved.&nbsp; 
      Scalings can be 1.5 or integers from 2 to 8.</p>
    <p>Select <strong>Whole image at 1:1 zoom</strong> to save the full image as if it 
      were displayed at a zoom of 1, including anything that would be outside the 
      window at that zoom.</p>
    <p><strong>Increase text/line sizes by</strong></p>
    <p>With this option on, the program will scale up text sizes, line thicknesses, 
      and the line lengths for crosses by the chosen amount.&nbsp; The default setting 
      is shown as &quot;Scaling&quot;, which means that the sizes will be scaled by the same 
      amount as the image is scaled to take the snapshot.&nbsp; Choose this if you 
      plan to view the image at about the same size as it is currently displayed, such 
      as when taking a high-resolution image for publication.&nbsp; In general, choose 
      a scaling that will make the features be an appropriate size for the zoom at 
      which you plan to view the snapshot.&nbsp; With the option off, features are 
      drawn at their normal size regardless of how big the saved image; this is 
      appropriate when you are applying no scaling or very little, or if you plan to 
      examine the saved image at a zoom near 1.</p>
    <p><strong>Include features drawn on image</strong></p>
    <p>With this option on, the marker point or a drawn line or box, low dose areas, 
      FFT rings, and Navigator features will be drawn in the snapshot.&nbsp; With the 
      option off, only the scale bar and its label will be drawn.&nbsp; (The scale bar 
      can be turned off in the options section of the <a href="hidd_imagelevel.htm">
      Image Display Control</a> panel.)&nbsp; The 'SnapshopToFile' script command 
      allows separate control of the drawing of Navigator items and other features.</p>
    <p><strong>Save as TIFF or JPEG</strong></p>
    <p>Select the type of file to save.</p>
    <p><strong>Type of compression in TIFF file</strong></p>
    <p>Select whether to use compression in a TIFF file and the type of compression.&nbsp; 
      ZIP and LZW are both loss-less compressions and will generally not reduce file 
      size by a large amount except in special cases.&nbsp; LZW is particularly 
      effective when there are runs of similar pixel values; ZIP is the compression 
      use in PNG files.&nbsp; JPEG compression is the method used in JPEG file and 
      does lose information.&nbsp; However, the compression may be much less effective 
      than when saving a JPEG file in some cases.</p>
    <p><strong>JPEG compression quality (%)</strong></p>
    <p>The text box and spinner let you specify the compression quality used when 
      saving a JPEG file or a TIFF file with JPEG compression.&nbsp; The default of 
      80% is usually fine for images but may give unacceptable distortion or dimming 
      of colored features for applications where a good quality image is needed.</p>
    <p><strong>Snapshot</strong></p>
    <p>Press this button to take the snapshot.&nbsp; A file chooser will open.&nbsp; 
      The first time, you will need to specify a location and filename.&nbsp; 
      Thereafter, the program will increment a number at the end of the filename 
      before the extension or add 1 if there is no number there, so that you can save 
      an automatically numbered sequence of files.</p>
