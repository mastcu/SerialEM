      <BR>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_tiltseries"></A><B>Setup/Start command (Tilt Series menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to open the <A HREF="hidd_tiltseries.htm">Tilt Series Setup dialog 
          box</A> to set the parameters for a new tilt series and start the series, 
        or to adjust the parameters of one that is running. If a tilt series is already 
        running, you will have the option of resuming the series at the next step in 
        its sequence, or of leaving the dialog box and resuming the tilt series at 
        another point through the <A HREF="hidd_tsresume.htm">Tilt Series Resume dialog box</A>
        .</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_terminate"></A><B>Terminate command (Tilt Series menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to terminate a tilt series and restore all program controls to 
        their normal state. The Tilt Series Controller will no longer control the 
        various buffer and saving options in the program. You will have the option of 
        leaving your image file open or closing it. For a tilt series run in batch mode 
        from the Navigator, the tilt series will be terminated, the file will be 
        closed, and the Navigator will go on to the next tilt series.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_extraoutput"></A><B>Extra Output command (Tilt Series menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to open the <A HREF="hidd_tsextrafile.htm">Tilt Series Extra Output 
          dialog box</A> to control output of images to additional windows or image 
        files. You can have a separate window that holds a buffer stack with binned 
        down copies of the final Record or montage overviews during a tilt series. You 
        can save each type of image shot by the Tilt Series Controller (autofocus, 
        tracking, and preview in low dose mode) to a separate output file. You can also 
        use this dialog to do a series of Record images at different focus settings or 
        at different filter settings.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_futurepolicies"></A><B>Batch Policies command (Tilt Series 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to open the <A HREF="hidd_tspolicies.htm">Tilt Series Batch Policy 
          dialog box</A> to control how errors are handled during a tilt series 
        started automatically from the Navigator. The most important choice is between 
        having the series stop with a message box after an error to allow the usual 
        kinds of interventions, versus having the series automatically terminated. If 
        the latter is selected, other choices essentially answer the various message 
        boxes that give the user a choice after an error.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_resetpoleangle"></A><B>Reset Pole Angle command (Tilt Series 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>When the program finds that the stage has not tilted as much as expected, it 
        stops and asks if you want to stop the tilt series. If you answer yes, it sets 
        this angle as an internal 'pole touch' angle beyond which it will not tilt. If 
        you answer yes incorrectly, you will not be able to go on until you use this 
        command to reset the 'pole touch' angle and remove this limitation.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_run_macro"></A><B>Run Script in TS command (Tilt Series 
          menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to run a chosen script before a selected step in the tilt series 
      loop.&nbsp; 
      The available steps are the tracking shot before autofocus, autofocus, the tracking shot after autofocus, and the Record or 
      Montage.&nbsp; The script will be run on every loop of the tilt series, 
      regardless of whether the chosen step is performed at that tilt angle or ever.&nbsp; 
      This command is disabled until a script number is set with the following command.</P>
    <P>Unlike when running scripts from the Navigator, there are no layers of control 
      in this situation; if the script is stopped, this will stop the tilt series, and 
      there will be no way to resume the script from the stopping point. The tilt 
      series will also stop if there is an error in the script. It should be possible 
      to make the script run again by selecting to go back to an earlier step when 
      resuming the tilt series.&nbsp; The script can be edited, and the selections of 
      which script and which step can be changed, whenever the tilt series is stopped.</P>
    <P>There are no protections against running a script that interferes with the Tilt 
      Series Controller's operations and controls in some way, such as by manipulating 
      open files or copying buffers.&nbsp; Malfunctions or crashes would be expected 
      in such cases.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_setmacrotorun"></A><B>Set Script To Run command (Tilt Series 
          menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to enter the script number of a script to be run during the 
      series, then a number for the step in the series of actions at which to run the 
      script.&nbsp; The entry box for the latter will list the available steps, 
      numbered from one.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_call_ts_plugin"></A><B>Call TS Plugins command (Tilt 
      Series menu)</B></P>
    <P>It is possible for SerialEM plugins to provide functions that can be called at 
      defined points in the tilt series.&nbsp; If this entry is checked, those 
      functions will be called.&nbsp; It is grayed out if there are no plugins loaded 
      with such functions.</P>
     <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_fixed_num_frames"></A><B>Fixed # of K2 Frames command (Tilt 
      Series menu)</B></P>
      <P>If this entry is checked, then if intensity is being changed during a tilt 
        series with a K2 camera, the program will adjust the frame time to keep the 
        number of frames constant.&nbsp; Aside from keeping the signal-to-noise ratio of 
        the frames comparable, this may also result in finer changes in exposure time, 
        which would otherwise be constrained to be a multiple of a fixed frame time.&nbsp; 
        However, there may be increased drift within the early frames for the longer 
        frame times.&nbsp; This adjustment will not be made if you have scheduled 
        changes in frame time explicitly with the <a href="hidd_tsvariations.htm">Tilt 
        Series Scheduled Changes</a> dialog.</P>
     <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_sendemail"></A><B>Send Email at End command (Tilt 
        Series menu) menu)</B></P>
      <P>If this entry is checked, SerialEM will send an email when a tilt series reaches 
        its end or stops in need of attention, except when the stop is immediately 
        after an action that you have taken. To send email, an SMTP server and an 
        address to send from must be defined in the SerialEM properties file, and you 
        must enter an email address with the 'Set Email Address' command described 
        next.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_setaddress"></A><B>Set Email Address command (Tilt Series 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set the address(es) to which emails from SerialEM will be 
        sent. You can enter more than one address, separated by commas or spaces. The 
        address entered here will be used for any emails sent from SerialEM; i.e., ones 
        sent by the Navigator as well as ones after a tilt series stops.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_stop"></A><B>Stop command (Tilt Series menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to stop a tilt series at the next logical step. The Tilt Series 
        Controller will still be in control of the program. If you open the <A HREF="hidd_tsresume.htm">
          Tilt Series Resume dialog box</A> you will be able to see exactly where the 
        series stopped, because the dialog box contains a statement of the next action 
        to be performed.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_endloop"></A><B>End Loop command (Tilt Series menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to stop a tilt series after all actions have been completed at 
        the current tilt angle. The Tilt Series Controller will still be in control of 
        the program.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_backup"></A><B>Back Up command (Tilt Series menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to open the <A HREF="hidd_tsresume.htm">Tilt Series Back Up dialog 
          box</A> in order to back up to a previous tilt angle and redo operations 
        from that point. You can use this procedure more than once, if necessary, 
        before selecting the point from which you want to resume. When you back up, the 
        Tilt Series Controller will try to set up an appropriate reference image for 
        the new tilt angle.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_resume"></A><B>Resume command (Tilt Series menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to open the <A HREF="hidd_tsresume.htm">Tilt Series Resume dialog 
          box</A> . This dialog box will give you a chance to change the next action 
        to be performed. You can choose to redo some actions at the current tilt angle, 
        or, to a limited extent, you can skip some actions that you have performed 
        manually.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_oneloop"></A><B>One Loop command (Tilt Series menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to perform one loop of a tilt series. The Tilt Series 
        Controller will resume from the point at which it was stopped and will go on 
        until all operations are complete at a tilt angle.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_onestep"></A><B>One Step command (Tilt Series menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to advance one step of the tilt series. There will be a 
        message in the log saying which step is executed.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_savex"></A><B>Save X/Y/Z File command (Tilt Series menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to save a text file with a list of tilt angles and X, Y, and Z 
      positions in the order in which they occurred during the series.&nbsp; The file 
      may be saved after the tilt series is finished, or a partial file can be saved 
      any time that the series is stopped.&nbsp; The data are available for saving 
      until the next tilt series is started.</P>
    <P>With IMOD 4.7, a simple plot of the data can be generated with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; onegenplot -col 1,2,3,4 filename.txt<br />
      with other options available to embellish the plot if desired.&nbsp; With IMOD 
      4.8.40 or later, a properly labeled plot with different colors can be produced 
      with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tomodataplots -typ 14 filename.txt<br />
      where the option '-con 1' can be used to add connecting lines between the 
      points.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_autosavex"></A><B>Autosave X/Y/Z File command (Tilt Series menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to toggle automatic saving of a text file with a list of tilt 
      angles and X, Y, and Z positions at the end of each tilt series.&nbsp; If the 
      output file name is 'imagefile.mrc', this file will have the name 
      'imagefile_xyz.txt'</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_verbose"></A><B>Verbose command (Tilt Series menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to toggle output of tracking and prediction information and 
        other status messages to the Log window during a tilt series. If this item is 
        not checked, then only the summary information about each image saved will be 
        printed.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_autosavelog"></A><B>Autosave Log command (Tilt Series menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to toggle automatic saving of the Log Window to a file after 
        every tilt. If the Log Window has not yet been saved to a file, a log file will 
        be started with a name derived from the name of the tilt series output file.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tiltseries_debugmode"></A><B>Debug Mode command (Tilt Series menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to toggle output to the Log Window of numerous state variables 
        in the Tilt Series Controller. The output will occur before each action.</P>
