        Fitting Parameters Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog allows you to set parameters controlling CTF fitting to
    FFTs; they all affect the fitting when clicking in an FFT, and some also
    affect fitting with the Ctffind and Ctfplotter script commands.&nbsp; The dialog can be kept open 
        while getting images and fitting to them.&nbsp; If an FFT is being displayed 
        with a CTF fit drawn on it, then the program will redo the fit whenever you 
        change most values in this dialog.</p>
    <p><strong>Use Ctfplotter for: Fit on Click</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option to use Ctfplotter instead Ctffind for CTF fitting when 
      clicking in an FFT.&nbsp; Ctfplotter gives ~10-30% less variable results for 
      astigmatism, on average, with typical images, and takes somewhat longer to run.&nbsp; 
      It shows significant advantages with weaker CTF signal and tilted images.&nbsp; 
      If you find that you need to turn off astigmatism fitting with Ctffind, try 
      Ctfplotter.</p>
    <p><strong>Use Ctfplotter for: Fits for tuning</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option to use Ctfplotter instead Ctffind for CTF fitting when 
      calibrating or correcting astigmatism or when correcting coma.&nbsp; Tests at 
      200 kV with a cross-line gratig showed that Ctfplotter was ~30% more accurate 
      for coma correction, but no better for astigmatism correction.&nbsp; Ctfplotter 
      may not work correctly in this context with images having high astigmatism (&gt;= 1 
      micron), but then Ctfplotter may not either.</p>
    <p><b>Use slower search, needed for high astigmatism&nbsp; <em>(Ctffind only)</em></b></p>
    <p>Select this option to do a slower 2-D initial exhaustive search instead of the default 
        1-D search with a rotational averaged spectrum.&nbsp; This search is needed if 
        the astigmatism is large (for example, if analyzing images with beam-tilt). 
        Although it 
        should not be needed for ordinary amounts of astigmatism, fitting is apparently 
        more reliable with it on, so the 2-D search is recommended unless you find it 
        too slow.&nbsp; The 2-D search 
        is parallelized so its speed will depend heavily on the number of computer cores 
        available.&nbsp; Including phase in the search will slow it down considerably.</p>
    <p><b>Compute resolution to which Thon rings fit <em>(Ctffind only)</em></b></p>
    <p>Select this option do the extra computations needed to determine the resolution to 
        which the Thon rings can be fit, or 0 not to.&nbsp; These computations will 
        increase the fitting time by 10-20%, which may be noticeable.</p>
    <p><b>Draw rings to computed resolution <em>(Ctffind)</em> or to end of fitting 
      range <em>(Ctfplotter)</em></b></p>
    <p>Select this option to draw half-rings on the image either out to the resolution determined by 
        these extra computations if they were done with Ctffind, or to the end of the 
      fitting range used with Ctfplotter, which is based on a local correlation 
      between the power spectrum and fitted CTF curve.</p>
    <p><b>Custom value of highest resolution to fit&nbsp; <em>(Ctffind only)</em></b></p>
    <p>Enter a limiting value to the maximum resolution to which to fit the amplitude 
        spectrum, in Angstroms.&nbsp; A smaller value fits farther out in frequency 
        space.&nbsp; The minimum allowed value is 3 unless you enter 0 to revert to the 
        default.&nbsp; The line below this text box shows the default value that will be 
        used if the entry here is 0.&nbsp; This default may be set in the SerialEM 
        properties file. If there is no property setting, the default is 5 if the voltage on program 
        startup is above 120 KV, which is the same as the default 
        maximum resolution in Ctffind4, and 10 otherwise.&nbsp; SerialEM will choose a maximum resolution 
        higher than this value when the defocus is high and the minimum resolution is a 
        high number as well.&nbsp; However, with a non-FEG microscope or other situation 
        where Thon rings may never approach this resolution, a higher value may be 
        needed here or in the properties file.&nbsp; If you click in an FFT with the middle mouse button, the 
        status bar will show the resolution (&#39;Period&#39;) at that frequency.</p>
      <p>The value set here applies when fitting with the Ctffind script command.</p>
      <p><b>Fixed phase shift when not finding phase</b></p>
      <p>Enter a fixed phase shift imposed by a phase plate (a positive value in degrees).&nbsp; 
          This phase shift will be taken into account when circles are drawn on a live FFT 
          for the fixed defocus defined by the&nbsp;<A HREF="menu_process.htm#hid_process_setdefocusforcircles">Set Defocus for Circles</A> command, when a defocus is reported after left-clicking on an FFT 
          without CTF fitting turned on, and when doing CTF fitting by clicking in the FFT 
          if phase is not being searched for.&nbsp; If a 
        non-zero shift has been entered, the defocus in the status bar will be followed 
        by &#39;: PP&#39;.</p>
    <p><b>Lowest resolution to fit when fitting with phase </b></p>
    <p>Enter a limiting value to the minimum resolution in Angstroms for fitting when 
        phase is non-zero, i.e., when searching for phase or using a fixed phase shift.&nbsp; 
        A smaller value starts the fit farther from the origin in frequency space.&nbsp; This limit applies either when a constant phase shift 
        is assumed or when the phase is being found in a fit with the &#39;Ctffind&#39; script 
        command.&nbsp; This limit provides a maximum value for the minimum resolution 
        and can be used to exclude the region before the first zero, or even the first 
        zero from fitting, since the spectrum here may be distorted due to a gradual cut-on in the phase shift at low frequencies.&nbsp; 
        However, the minimum resolution may end up being higher than this limit since it 
        is also constrained to be least 1.5 times the maximum resolution used for a 
        particular fit.&nbsp; Enter 0 for no limit.&nbsp; The standard value used by 
        some phase plate experts seems to be 20 A.</p>
      <p>The value set here applies when fitting with the Ctffind script command.</p>
    <p><b>Find phase with search limits </b></p>
    <p>Select this option to find the phase shift as well as defocus and astigmatism.&nbsp; 
        An initial exhaustive coarse search for the best fit will be done with a step 
        size of 6 degrees, followed by a conjugate gradient minimization.&nbsp; In the 
        text boxes, set the minimum and maximum phase of the initial search, in degrees.&nbsp; 
        This search will be slower and may be unreliable with weaker data unless the 
        following option is used to fix the astigmatism at 0.</p>
    <p><b>Omit astigmatism when searching for phase </b></p>
    <p>Select this option to fix astigmatism at zero when searching for phase.&nbsp; 
        This will reduce the dimensionality of searches from 4 to 2, increasing the 
        speed and reliability of the fitting.</p>
