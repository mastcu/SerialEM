    <P>
      This page describes the mechanism for hiding or disabling menu items and dialog 
      elements in SerialEM.&nbsp; This can be done either to prevent users from doing 
      some operations, or to simplify the interface for some users.&nbsp; There can be 
      two different files, corresponding to these two main purposes, listing items to 
      be hidden or disabled.&nbsp; One kind of file modifies the interface 
      unconditionally during the run of the program; it is specified with the property 
      entry &#39;DisableOrHideFile&#39; followed by the full path of the file, which can be 
      anywhere.&nbsp; The other kind of file defines a basic mode for the interface 
      that can be toggled with the <a href="menu_settings.htm#hid_settings_basicmode">
      Basic Mode</a> command in the Settings menu.&nbsp; By default, the program will 
      look for such a file, named &#39;SEMbasicModeItems.txt&#39; in the system directory 
      where the properties and calibration files reside.&nbsp; The property 
      &#39;BasicModeDisableHideFile&#39; can be entered with the full path to an alternative 
      file, which can be anywhere and named anything.</P>
    <P>
      Before you add a &#39;DisableOrHideFile&#39; entry that makes settings unavailable, be 
      sure that the settings files being used have good values for those settings, 
      since it will become impossible for users to fix a bad value.</P>
    <P>
      Each line in one of these files consists of two entries: an initial value of 1 
      or 2 to indicate whether the item should be disabled or hidden, and a unique 
      identifier for the item.&nbsp; The first table below lists items for which the 
      identifier is a string that is defined in the program; when using one of these, 
      you need to copy the exact string shown.&nbsp; However, any item in the 
      program&#39;s menus can be hidden simply by entering its numeric ID as the 
      identifier for that item, so the second table below lists these IDs for all menu 
      items.&nbsp; That table also shows the menu strings; these are not required in 
      the file, but you should copy enough of the string so that you know what the 
      item is afterwards.<P>
      These files can also have blank lines and comment lines with a # as the first 
      character.&nbsp; A special line can be included to make the program skip the rest of 
        the file if its version is too low:<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        EndIfVersionBelow ######<br />
        The integer version '#####' is 10000 times the first digit, plus
            100 times the release number, plus the update value; thus use 40100 to skip
            properties not defined in version 4.0.&nbsp; More than one entry is allowed; 
           the one for the earlier version should come before the later version.
        <p>Guenter Resch has constructed a web page at <a href="https://www.nexperion.net/basicmodefile">
          https://www.nexperion.net/basicmodefile</a> 
          that will prepare a Basic mode file customized for a specific set of activities;
           this should be a good starting point for your own Basic mode file.
        </p>
    <p>An example file for a Basic mode constructed by Tillman Schaefer is available at 
      <a href="https://bio3d.colorado.edu/ftp/SerialEM/Tools/SEMbasicModeItems.txt">
            https://bio3d.colorado.edu/ftp/SerialEM/Tools/SEMbasicModeItems.txt</a>.

      <strong>Table of Items Defined by Strings</strong><P>
      These are items currently eligible to be hidden.&nbsp; 
      (No disabling has been requested, and it would be more difficult to implement 
      generically than hiding).&nbsp; If you want 
      to have an item added to this table, contact the SerialEM developers.&nbsp; To 
      hide or disable an item, you must copy the whole identifier string shown here 
      into your file to use it.&nbsp; The entries in this table start with &#39;1&#39; if the 
      item can disabled but not hidden, &#39;2&#39; if the item can be hidden but not 
      disabled, or &#39;1 OR 2&#39; if it can both hidden and disabled.&nbsp; In the latter 
      case, after copying the line, remove the &#39;OR 2&#39; to disable the item or &#39;1 OR&#39; to 
      hide the item.<P>
      The first few lines of this table illustrate some features:<ul>
      <li>Some entries will hide all the elements on a dialog line.</li>
      <li>To hide the contents of a group box, you must also include the string for the 
        group box as well as the one(s) for the items in the box.&nbsp; If all the items 
        are in one line, it will take only one entry to hide them; if they are 
        vertically arranged, a separate entry will be needed for each.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Menu items will be identified with part or all of the menu name, items 
        in dialogs will have a string based on the dialog.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Submenu items will have a string indicating the submenu name.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;An entire top-level menu or submenu can be hidden.</li>
      <li>Control panels can be hidden, or just the options sections of them.</li>
    </ul>

      <strong>Table of All Menu Items and Their IDs</strong></P>
    <P>
      To hide a menu item not listed above, you can copy the line for that item from 
      this table into your file.&nbsp; The text after the ID number is optional but 
      will help you identify the entry.<pre>
        INSERT MENU ID LIST HERE
