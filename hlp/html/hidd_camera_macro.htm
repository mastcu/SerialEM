    <P>This panel has buttons for taking images and controlling scripts or actions 
      during a tilt series. Several of the buttons will change when the Tilt Series 
      Controller is activated and when data are being acquired at points through the 
      Navigator.&nbsp; The three script buttons can be used not only to run the 
      selected script but also to open an editor for an existing script, by holding down 
      the Ctrl key while clicking on the button.</P>
    <P><B>Setup</B></P>
    <P>This button will open the <A HREF="hidd_camerasetup.htm">Camera Setup dialog box</A>
      and allow you to set parameters like exposure time, field of view and binning 
      for the 5 different exposure modes
    </P>
    <P><B>View</B></P>
    <P><B>Focus</B></P>
    <P><B>Trial</B></P>
    <P><B>Record</B></P>
    <P>These buttons will acquire an image using the View, Focus, Trial, or Record 
      parameters.</P>
    <P><B>Preview/Montage</B></P>
    <P>Ordinarily, this button will acquire an image with the Preview parameter set. If 
      montaging has been started, the button will acquire a montaged image.</P>
    <P><B>End</B></P>
    <P>This button has several uses for ending an operation in an orderly fashion, and 
      its label sometimes changes accordingly. If a script is running, this button 
      will end the script at the end of a loop or at the end of the script. If the Tilt 
      Series Controller is active, the button will stop the series after completing 
      all actions at the current tilt angle. If a script or tilt series was being run 
      from the Navigator and was stopped, this button can also be used to terminate 
      the script at the current position, or terminate the tilt series, and allow the 
      Navigator to go on to the next position. Otherwise, when the Navigator is 
      acquiring data, the button will signal the Navigator to end its acquisitions 
      after finishing the current item.</P>
    <P><B>Resume</B></P>
    <P>If a script has been running, this button will resume the script at the next step. 
      If the Tilt Series Controller is active, the button will open the <A HREF="hidd_tsresume.htm">
        Tilt Series Resume dialog box</A>
    </P>
    <P><B>STOP</B></P>
    <P>This is a general Stop button for image acquisition, autofocus, montaging, 
      scripts, tasks, tilt series, or any other extended sequence of actions. It will 
      generally stop the activity as soon as possible after the current action. When 
      you are running a tilt series or a script from the Navigator, the Stop button 
      acts on the lowest level of operation only.</P>
    <P><B>Script/One Loop</B></P>
    <P>If the Tilt Series Controller is not active, this button will execute the script 
      shown on the button; otherwise it will execute one loop of the tilt series. The 
      program will stop at the same place where the End button would stop it, after 
      finishing all actions at a tilt angle.</P>
    <P><B>Script/One Step</B></P>
    <P>If the Tilt Series Controller is not active, this button will execute the script 
      shown on the button; otherwise it will advance one step of the tilt series. 
      There are many more steps in the loop of the Tilt Series Controller than actual 
      actions under particular conditions, but it should generally stop after the next 
      actual action.</P>
    <P><B>Script/Back Up</B></P>
    <P>If the Tilt Series Controller is not active, this button will execute the script 
      shown on the button; otherwise it will open the <A HREF="hidd_tsbackup.htm">Tilt 
        Series Back Up dialog box</A>
    </P>
    <P><B>Script Selector Spin Buttons</B></P>
    <P>These spin buttons will change the script number activated by the associated 
      Script button.</P>
