    <P>This panel has buttons for taking images and controlling scripts or actions 
      during a tilt series. Several of the buttons will change when the Tilt Series 
      Controller is activated and when data are being acquired at points through the 
      Navigator.&nbsp; The three script buttons can be used not only to run the 
      selected script but also to open an editor for an existing script, by holding down 
      the Ctrl key while clicking on the button.</P>
    <P><B>Setup</B></P>
    <P>This button will open the <A HREF="hidd_camerasetup.htm">Camera Setup dialog box</A>
      and allow you to set parameters like exposure time, field of view and binning 
      for the 5 different exposure modes
    </P>
    <P><B>View</B></P>
    <P><B>Focus</B></P>
    <P><B>Trial</B></P>
    <P><B>Record</B></P>
    <P>These buttons will acquire an image using the View, Focus, Trial, or Record 
      parameters.</P>
    <P><B>Preview/Montage</B></P>
    <P>Ordinarily, this button will acquire an image with the Preview parameter set. If 
      montaging has been started, the button will acquire a montaged image.</P>
    <P><B>End</B></P>
    <P>This button has several uses for ending an operation in an orderly fashion, and 
      its label sometimes changes accordingly. If a script is running, this button 
      (labeled <b>End Loop</b>) will end the script at the end of a loop or at the end of the script. If the Tilt 
      Series Controller is active, the button (<b>End Loop</b>) will stop the series after completing 
      all actions at the current tilt angle. If a script or tilt series was being run 
      from the Navigator and was stopped, this button can also be used to terminate 
      the script at the current position (<b>End Script</b>), or terminate the tilt series 
      (<b>End TS</b>), and allow the Navigator to go on to the next position. </P>
    <P><B>Resume/PauseN/End Nav)</B></P>
    <P>If a script has been running and was stopped, this button will resume the script at the next step. 
      If the Tilt Series Controller is active, the button will open the <A HREF="hidd_tsresume.htm">
        Tilt Series Resume dialog box</A>. When acquisition of tilt series 
      is being run from the Navigator, the button is labeled <b>End Nav</b> while the tilt 
      series is running and will stop the Navigator acquisition at the end of the 
      current tilt series.&nbsp; If a tilt series run from the Navigator or a script 
      prior to a tilt series is stopped, the button is labeled <b>ResumeT</b> 
      if it will resume the tilt series, or <b>ResumeS</b> if it will resume the 
      script.&nbsp; When other acquisitions are running from the Navigator, the button 
      (labeled <b>PauseN</b>) will pause the acquisition after the current item, and 
      it can then be resumed with the same button, labeled <b>ResumeN</b>.</P>
    <P><B>STOP/EndNav/End All</B></P>
    <P>This is a general Stop button for image acquisition, autofocus, montaging, 
      scripts, tasks, tilt series, or any other extended sequence of actions. It will 
      generally stop the activity as soon as possible after the current action. When 
      you are running a tilt series or a script from the Navigator, the Stop button 
      acts on the lowest level of operation only, so it can leave a tilt series or 
      script in a suspended state.&nbsp; However, once such a tilt series is stopped,&nbsp; 
      the button is labeled <b>EndNav</b> and will end the Navigator acquisition after 
      the current item; and if a script is stopped, the button is labeled <b>End All</b> 
      and will stop acquisition immediately.</P>
    <P><B>Script/One Loop</B></P>
    <P>If the Tilt Series Controller is not active, this button will execute the script 
      shown on the button; otherwise it will execute one loop of the tilt series. The 
      program will stop at the same place where the <b>End Loop</b> button would stop it, after 
      finishing all actions at a tilt angle.</P>
    <P><B>Script/One Step/End Nav</B></P>
    <P>If the Tilt Series Controller is not active, this button will execute the script 
      shown on the button; otherwise it will advance one step of the tilt series. 
      There are many more steps in the loop of the Tilt Series Controller than actual 
      actions under particular conditions, but it should generally stop after the next 
      actual action.&nbsp; When the Navigator is controlling acquisition, this button 
      is labeled <b>End Nav</b> in a variety of circumstances.&nbsp; In most cases, it 
      will end the Navigator acquisition after the current item; however, if 
      acquisition was paused with the PauseN button and has finished an item, then 
      this button will end the acquisition immediately.</P>
    <P><B>Script/Back Up</B></P>
    <P>If the Tilt Series Controller is not active, this button will execute the script 
      shown on the button; otherwise it will open the <A HREF="hidd_tsbackup.htm">Tilt 
        Series Back Up dialog box</A>
    </P>
    <P><B>Script Selector Spin Buttons</B></P>
    <P>These spin buttons will change the script number activated by the associated 
      Script button.</P>
