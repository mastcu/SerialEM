      <P>The Navigator window is used to keep track of stage positions and low 
        magnification maps and can assist with locating positions on the grid after it 
        has been rotated or repositioned in the holder. Each stage position and 
        associated information is referred to as an item. The window has five kinds of 
        controls; the table below has links to the controls with the most lengthy 
        explanations:</P>

        </TR>
      </TABLE>
      <BR>

      <P>The Navigator window can be resized to show more or less of the list box.</P>
      <P><i><A NAME="nav_current_item"></A><B><FONT size="3">Properties of Current Item</FONT></B></i></P>
      <P><B>Label</B></P>
      <P>The label is a short identifier that will be drawn on the image. The Navigator 
        will assign labels as sequential numbers but you are free to edit them to say 
        something more meaningful.&nbsp; When groups are collapsed and a single item is 
        selected in a group, the label of that item will be shown.</P>
      <P><B>Registration Point</B></P>
      <P>Use this check box to mark a point as a registration point, which can be used to 
        transform locations when the grid is repositioned in the holder. The first time 
        that you set up a registration, you can use the spin buttons to select a unique 
        point number (this should happen automatically). When you are adding 
        corresponding points in a new registration, use the spin buttons to make each 
        point number match the number of the corresponding point in the previous 
        registration.</P>
      <P><B>Corner Point</B></P>
      <P>Use this check box to mark a point as a corner of an area for which you want to 
        construct a montage.</P>
      <P><B>Color</B></P>
      <P>You can change the color of an item with this selector. By default, single 
        points are red, drawn polygons are green, maps are blue, and supermontage 
        polygons are yellow.&nbsp; You can also select &quot;NoRealign&quot; here either to prevent a map 
        from being used for the first stage of the Realign to Item routine, or to 
        prevent a higher magnification map from being aligned to in a second stage when 
        realigning to that map.&nbsp; 
        The item will be drawn in dark blue in this case.&nbsp; When a point or map is 
        marked for acquisition and still has its default color, it is shown in a 
        brighter red or blue, respectively (not quite magenta or not quite cyan).&nbsp; 
        A point that is the current item or that is one of multiple selected items is 
        shown in orange-yellow.&nbsp; In both of these cases, the item still has the 
        basic color shown in this box.</P>
      <P><B>Draw</B></P>
      <P>Use this check box to control whether an item is drawn on images that it falls 
        within.&nbsp; When groups are collapsed and a group is selected in the table, 
        this box is still available as long as all items summarized on that table line 
        have the same drawing state, and it can be used to toggle the drawing on or off 
        for all of those items.</P>
      <P><B>Rotate when load</B></P>
      <P>Turn on this check box to have a newly loaded map automatically rotated into the 
        same orientation as images at the current magnification. Rotation can take many 
        seconds for very large maps.</P>
      <P><B>For anchor state</B></P>
      <P>Use this check box to mark a map item as a template for acquiring further 
        medium-magnification maps that will be suitable for realigning to. Only one map 
        item can be marked as such a template, so if there is already a map marked for 
        this, it will be unselected when you check the box for a new item. See <B>Anchor Map</B>
        below for details.</P>
      <P><B>Item #</B></P>
      <P>To the left of the Note text box appears the number of the current item in the 
        table, numbered from 1. When the current table line is a summary of a group of 
        points, their range of item numbers is shown.</P>
      <P><B>Note</B></P>
      <P>This text box allows you enter an arbitrarily long note about the current item.</P>
      <P><b><i><A NAME="nav_acquire_controls"></A>Acquisition Controls<B><FONT size="3"></FONT></B></i></b></P>
      <P>The controls in this section allow items to be marked for particular kinds of 
        acquisition, including tilt series and montaging, both of which involve numerous 
        parameters that can be changed from one item to another.&nbsp; As of SerialEM 
        3.9, 6/16/21, all of the tilt series and montaging parameters, names of files to 
        be opened for individual items, and options associated with those files are 
        saved to the Navigator file and will be restored when a file is reloaded.&nbsp; 
        However, imaging states are not saved, nor is information about files to be 
        opened at groups.</P>
    <P><B><A NAME="navac_acquire"></A>Acquire</B></P>
      <P>Use this check box to mark an item as a position to be acquired automatically. 
        After marking such items, you can use the <A HREF="menu_navigator.htm#hidc_navigator_acquire">
          Acquire at Items command</A> to open the <A HREF="hidd_navacquire.htm">Navigator 
          Acquire dialog box</A> and then acquire images at the sequence of locations 
        and make each into a map, or perform other actions at each location. There are 
        three hot keys that can be used to toggle this option on or off, provided that 
        the main program window has the keyboard focus. The A key will just toggle the 
        item currently selected in the list box. Ctrl-Shift-A will toggle all of the 
        items. Shift-A can be used to toggle a selected range of items, but it has to 
        be pressed twice to do so. First select the item at one end of the range with 
        the mouse (or arrow keys) and press Shift-A. Then make the item at the other 
        end of the range be the current item, and press Shift-A again. The Acquire 
        state will be toggled for items between the first and second selection, except 
        for items marked for tilt series.</P>
      <P><B><A NAME="navac_tiltseries"></A>Tilt Series</B></P>
      <P>Use this checkbox to set up a tilt series to be acquired at the current item's 
        location. The first time that you select a tilt series, a series of dialogs 
        will open:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>
          A small dialog allowing you to specify whether the tilt series is a single 
          frame or a montage.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          The <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup dialog box</A> , if you 
          selected a montage.</LI>
        <LI>
          The <A HREF="hidd_fileproperties.htm">File Properties dialog box</A>
        </LI>
        <LI>
          The <A HREF="afx_hidd_filesave.htm">Save As dialog box</A> for specifying the 
          output file. The file will not be opened at this time, but the program will 
          check whether this same filename is already scheduled to be used.</LI>
        <LI>
          The <A HREF="hidd_tiltseries.htm">Tilt Series Setup dialog box</A> , allowing 
          you to set properties for this tilt series.
        </LI>
      </OL>
      <P>If you cancel any of these dialogs, or the filename you select is already in 
        use, the item will not be marked for a tilt series.</P>
      <P>When you select a tilt series for an item and there is an item before it in the 
        table already marked for a tilt series, no dialogs will open: all of the 
        properties will be inherited from the preceding item, and a new filename will 
        be generated by increasing a number, or adding one if there is no number in the 
        previous name. However, you can change any of these properties by pressing the <B>File 
          Properties</B>, <B>TS Parameters</B>, or <B>Filename</B> buttons, including 
        whether the file is single-frame or montage.</P>
    <P>When you use <B>TS Parameters</B> and leave the Tilt Series Setup dialog by 
      pressing <b>OK</b>, the selected item will be given a new set of parameters if 
      it is inheriting them from previous items.&nbsp; The new parameters will be 
      inherited by any following items that shared these parameters and that have not 
      been given their own parameters in this way.&nbsp; Similarly, when you use <B>File 
          Properties</B> and leave the File Properties dialog with <b>OK</b>, the 
      selected item will get its own parameters if they are being inherited from 
      previous ones, and any following ones sharing these parameters will inherit the 
      changes.&nbsp; Thus, the rule for both of these kinds of properties is that if 
      you have never gone through the dialog for an item, the item will inherit the 
      properties from the nearest previous item where you have gone through the 
      dialog.&nbsp; The log window will show messages about these effects of changing 
      parameters.</P>
      <P>An imaging state will not be set for a tilt series unless you press the <B>
        Imaging State</B> button; when no state is set, the tilt series starts
        with whatever pre-existing state exists.  Press the button to save the
        current state, which includes the current
        camera and Record image size and exposure parameters and whether the
        program is in Low Dose mode or not.  When not in low dose, the state includes the beam
        intensity, spot size, and energy filter settings if any.  When in
        low dose, the Record area parameters are saved as a whole, which
        encompasses those same parameters plus the magnification.
    <P>Tilt series can be set up for a range of items by selecting an item at one end 
      of the range, pressing &#39;Shift T&#39;, selecting the item at the other end of the 
      range, and pressing &#39;Shift T&#39; again.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the range contains 
        multiple maps at the same stage position, any map at the same position as one 
        taken at higher magnification will be ignored.&nbsp; Thus, you can have Anchor 
        maps and high-mag maps interleaved in the range, and Anchor maps will be 
        ignored.&nbsp; If all items in the range not being ignored and not marked as 
        &#39;Acquire&#39; are already set for tilt series, this operation will turn off the tilt 
        series designations for all of them.&nbsp; Otherwise, tilt series will be set up 
        for each item not being ignored and not already marked as &#39;Acquire&#39; or &#39;Tilt series&#39;.</P>
      <P><B><A NAME="navac_newfile"></A>New file at item</B></P>
    <P>This checkbox allows you to open a new file
       for the current item if it is marked as 'Acquire'.&nbsp; These dialogs will open 
      the first time that you check this, and in some other cases:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>
          A small dialog allowing you to specify whether the tilt series is a single 
          frame or a montage. If you select montage and the item is a polygon, then you 
          also have the option to fit the montage to the polygon.&nbsp; This dialog also 
          has an option to do the fitting on future polygons without opening the <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">
          Montage Setup dialog</A>.</LI>
        <LI>
          The <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup dialog box</A> , if you 
          selected a montage.</LI>
        <LI>
          The <A HREF="hidd_fileproperties.htm">File Properties dialog box</A>, 
          unless the option not to show this dialog is selected there.</LI>
        <LI>
          The <A HREF="afx_hidd_filesave.htm">Save As dialog box</A> for specifying the 
          output file. The file will not be opened at this time, but the program will 
          check whether this same filename is already scheduled to be used.</LI></OL>
      <P>If you cancel any of these dialogs, or the filename you select is already in 
        use, the item will not be set for a new file.</P>
      <P>Usually, if there is a file scheduled to open for a preceding item marked 
        'Acquire', no dialogs will open: properties will be inherited from the 
        preceding item, and a new filename will be generated by increasing a number, or 
        adding one if there is no number in the previous name. These properties include 
        the list of montage pieces needed to fit to a polygon; thus, if the preceding 
        item has a montage fit to a polygon and the current item is a point, the new 
        file will be a montage fitting the shape of that polygon but taken at the new 
        location. You can then change the automatically inherited properties with the <B>File Properties</B> or <B>Filename</B> buttons, 
        including whether the file is single-frame or montage. Dialogs will open, 
        however, when the preceding item has a montage fit to a polygon, the current item is 
        a polygon, and you did not select the option in the initial small dialog to fit 
        without opening the montage dialog. </P>
    <P>New files can be set up at a range of items marked as &#39;Acquire&#39;, or at a subset of 
      items, by selecting an item at one end of the range, pressing &#39;Shift N&#39;, 
      selecting the item at the other end of the range, and pressing &#39;Shift N&#39; again.&nbsp; 
      If all eligible items in the range are already set for new files, this operation 
      will turn off the new file designations for all of them.&nbsp; However, if only 
      some or no items are set for files, an entry box will appear that allows three 
      choices:</P>
    <ol>
      <li>&nbsp;Enter 1 to open a new file at every eligible item.</li>
      <li>Enter a number greater than 1 to open files at the given interval between 
        point items; files will still be opened at all polygon items.</li>
      <li>Enter -1 to open files at polygons only, not at points.&nbsp; This entry 
        allows you to fit a new montage to each polygon and save images at points 
        between the polygons into the existing montage files.</li>
    </ol>
      <P><B><A NAME="navac_newfile_group"></A>New file at group</B></P>
      <P>Use this checkbox to set up a new file to be opened when the first item in a 
        group is about to be acquired. This option operates similarly to 'New file at 
        item', except that the option to fit a montage is not enabled. It does not 
        matter which item in the group is the current item, or whether the current line 
        is a summarized group, when you select this option.</P>
      <P>You will not be able to define a new file for a group if any item in the group 
        is marked as 'Tilt Series' or is set to have a new file opened at it. 
        Similarly, once a new file is scheduled for a group, the 'Tilt series' and 'New 
        file at item' options are not available for any items in the group.</P>
      <P><B><A NAME="navac_fileprops"></A>(Set) File Props</B></P>
      <P>Use this button to check or adjust the properties of a file that is scheduled to 
        be opened for image or tilt series acquisition. The small dialog will open to 
        allow you select montaging and fitting to a polygon if appropriate, then the <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">
          Montage Setup dialog box</A> , if you selected a montage, then the <A HREF="hidd_fileproperties.htm">
          File Properties dialog box</A> . If you cancel the latter box, changes made 
        in the montaging properties will be retained.&nbsp; These dialogs open from this 
        button even when you have selected options to skip them.</P>
      <P><B><A NAME="navac_imagestate"></A>(Set) Imaging State</B></P>
      <P>Use this button to store the current imaging state (microscope settings and 
        imaging parameters) as a state to be set when the current item is about to be 
        acquired.&nbsp; The button is enabled only for items where a file is set to be 
        opened.&nbsp; If a montage is to be opened in Low Dose mode, the stored state 
        will be for the Low Dose area to be used to acquire images, thus it can be 
        Record, View, or Search.&nbsp; When in Low Dose mode, the state also includes the axis position 
        of the Focus area, including rotation of the axis if any, and the amount that a subarea is displaced from the center in 
        the Focus camera parameters.&nbsp; One or both of these settings can thus be 
        varied between tilt series to focus on favorable locations, but if there is no 
          other reason to save the state, it is preferable to use the <strong>Focus Pos</strong> 
          button instead.&nbsp; The <strong>Imaging State</strong> button is enabled whenever there is a file set to be opened for 
        the current item or group of items (including for a tilt series). The state is 
        set when the Navigator first moves to the item position. Once you have a state 
        set, the acquisition code in the item table (in the Acq column) will have an S 
        at the end. To assess and modify the stored state for the current item, press <B>Scheduled</B> in the <A HREF="hidd_statedlg.htm">Imaging State dialog box</A> ,

      <P><strong>(Set) Focus Pos</strong></P>
      <P>Use this button to store a specific location of the Low Dose Focus area for the 
          item to be acquired.&nbsp; Just as for an imaging state, the position along the 
          inter-area axis, rotation of the axis from the tilt axis if any, and offset of 
          the subarea from the center of the camera field are stored and set when the item 
          is about to be acquired.&nbsp; Unlike the imaging state, this information is 
          stored as part of the Navigator item itself and saved in the Navigator file, so 
          it is not lost when the program is restarted.&nbsp; It is thus preferable to 
          save it this way instead of in a state, which is not stored to file.&nbsp; If 
          you do save a state as well, the state will be set first, then the parameters 
          saved with this button, overriding the values in the state.</P>
      <P>If the Focus position is saved for one item, it will stay the same for later 
          items being acquired, until the next one that has its own Focus position.</P>
      <P>Stored Focus positions are listed for every item by
          <a href="menu_navigator.htm#hid_montage_listfilestoopen">List Files/Series/States</a>.&nbsp; 
          To set a stored position, select the item in the table and press <B>Scheduled</B> in the <A HREF="hidd_statedlg.htm">Imaging State dialog box</A>.&nbsp; 
          You can see the position by reloading a View map at that position, or taking a 
          new View image there, and selecting Focus as the area to be defined in the Low 
          Dose control panel.&nbsp; At that point you can also modify the position by clicking 
          in such a View image, and store it by pressing this button again.&nbsp; Set the 
          Edit Focus description below for an alternative way to see and adjust the Focus 
          positions for items, which should be more convenient when working with maps.</P>
      <P>If you turn off&nbsp; &#39;Acquire&#39; or &#39;Tilt series&#39; for an item, the stored position 
          will be removed and not restored if you turn the check box back on, so toggling 
          the acquisition is a way to delete a stored position.&nbsp; When items are 
          acquired, their stored positions are not removed.</P>

      <P><B><A NAME="navgb_collapse"></A>Collapse Groups</B></P>
      <P>Items that are added together by various means are marked as belonging to a

        by a single line in the table, showing the number of items in the group, the 
        last 4 digits of the ID, the labels of the first and last points in the group, 
        and whether some or all items in the group are marked for acquisition (Acq) or 
        tilt series (TS). Several operations can be performed on all of the items 
        summarized in a line: updating the Z coordinate, changing acquire status, and 
        deleting. If you drag another item into the middle of a group, the items before 
        and after that nonmember will be summarized on separate lines. In such a case, 
        the operations just mentioned will be performed only on the items summarized on 
        the selected line, not on the whole group.</P>
      <P>When a summarized group is the current line, the 'Acquire' checkbox reflects 
        whether the first item in the group is marked as 'Acquire'. Toggling the 
        checkbox or typing 'A' will toggle the 'Acquire' status of the first item and 
        set all the other items summarized on that line to the same status, except for

        placed by clicking with the left mouse button.&nbsp; The box will also be 
        displayed around the endpoint of a drawn line; thus, you can hold down the Shift 
        key and press and hold the left mouse button, and move the box around with the 
        mouse.&nbsp; The acquisition area is defined by the size of a montage when 
        montaging is on, otherwise by the size of a Record image at the current 
        magnification or at the magnification of the Record area when in Low Dose mode.</P>
    <P><B><A NAME="navgb_editmode"></A>Edit Mode</B></P>
    <P>Use this check box to turn on a mode in which the mouse can be used for editing 
      points in a way similar to modeling mode in 3dmod.&nbsp; Ordinarily, Ctrl-left 
      button click can be used to select the nearest point or polygon as the current 
      item, which is drawn with thicker lines in the display.&nbsp; In Edit mode:</P>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Left button click</em> will select the nearest point or polygon as the current 
        item.</li>
      <li><em>Ctrl-left button click</em> will <b>add</b> the nearest point or polygon to a list 
        of selected items, or remove it from the list if it is already 
        selected.&nbsp; All selected items will be drawn with thicker lines.&nbsp; The
        <b>Delete Item</b> button can then be used to delete all points at once.&nbsp; Points 
        outside the image area can be selected, but determining the stage coordinates of 
        such points involves extrapolation. The wrong point may be selected as a result, 
        particularly if one piece of a montage map is loaded and points are being 
        selected outside that image.</li>
      <li><em>Ctrl-left button held down</em> while moving the mouse will add points to the 
        selection as the mouses passes over or near them.</li>
      <li><em>Left button double-click</em> will delete the nearest point if it is already the 
        current item, it is the only item selected, and the Ctrl or Shift key is not down.&nbsp; 
        To delete a point, you need to single-click to select it then double-click to 
        delete it.</li>
      <li><em>Shift-left button double-click</em> near one of the positions of a regular (non-custom) 
        multiple Record 
        pattern around the current item will exclude that position from acquisition.&nbsp;
         When any position is excluded, this item is locked into recording the 
        multiple Record pattern set at the time of exlusion, even if the pattern is changed
         before acquisition.</li>
      <li><em>Middle button click</em> will add a point to the group to which the current point 
        belongs.</li>
      <li><em>Right button click</em> will move the currently selected point to a new position.</li>
      <li><em>Backspace</em> will delete the currently selected point.</li>
      <li><b>Add Points</b>, <b>Add Polygon</b>, and <b>Move Item</b> can still be used

          <strong><A NAME="navgb_editfocus"></A>Edit Focus</strong></p>
      <p>
          Turn on this check box to be able to visualize and adjust the position of the 
          Low Dose Focus area for individual Navigator items by clicking in View images.&nbsp; 
          The View image can be a single frame image, a montage overview, or a piece from 
          a montage map loaded for a selected point.&nbsp; When the current item is marked 
          for acquisition (A or TS), a box representing the Record area is drawn with the 
          item at its center, and a box and circle for the Focus area are drawn at the 
          appropriate distance from the item, similar to what is shown when defining the 
          Focus area with the button in the Low Dose control panel but with dashed instead 
          of solid lines.&nbsp; The marker point will generally be placed at the center of 
          the Focus area.&nbsp; Clicking with the left mouse button to set the marker will 
          move the Focus area.&nbsp; (However, Ctrl-left click can still be used to select 
          the nearest point.)&nbsp; If the axis between Low Dose areas is not free to 
          rotate, only the position on the tilt axis will change.&nbsp; If axis rotation 
          is enabled for this item&#39;s Focus position, the angle will be changed as well.</p>
      <p>
          The Focus position initially shown for an item will be based on the position 
          stored for that item, if any; or on the position stored for the last preceding 
          acquisition item having a defined Focus position, if any.&nbsp; If no positions 
          have been store for the current or preceding items , the position shown will be 
          that of Focus area currently defined&nbsp; in the Low Dose panel.&nbsp; When you 
          change the position for an item, a new position will be stored for that item or 
          the existing position will be updated.&nbsp; Although these stored positions 
          include a possible subarea offset in the Focus camera parameters, clicking will 
          change only the image shift to the Focus area.</p>
    <p>
          With <strong>Edit Focus</strong> on, turning on <strong>Show Acquire</strong> 
          will display the Record and Focus areas on all points marked for acquisition.&nbsp; 
          This display takes precedence over showing multiple Record areas on all points 
          when the option for that is on.&nbsp; Toggle <strong>Edit Focus</strong> 
          off and on to visualize those areas relative to the Focus area.</p>
      <p>
          There are some restrictions.&nbsp; Low dose mode must be on.&nbsp; <strong>Edit Focus</strong> and <strong>Edit mode</strong> are mutually exclusive and turn each other off when selected.&nbsp; 
          Turning on &#39;Define area&#39; in the Low Dose panel disables the editing of Focus 
          areas here, but it is enabled again when the &#39;Define area&#39; returns to &#39;None&#39;.&nbsp; 
          There is no way to enable axis rotation here if it is not already enabled, or to 
          forbid it if it is enabled.&nbsp; 
          To do so, you would have to turn on &#39;Define area&#39; and enable or disable rotation in the Low 
          Dose panel, then use the <strong>Focus Pos</strong> button described above to store the 
          parameters currently defined in that panel.&nbsp; At that point, you can use the 
          mouse to set a position with or without the axis constraint, respectively.&nbsp; Similarly, to change the 
          camera subarea, you would need to use the <strong>Focus Pos</strong> button after 
          changing the camera parameters.</p>
      <p>
          It is possible to set and edit focus positions in View maps loaded into an 
          off-line (&#39;dummy&#39;) instance of SerialEM.&nbsp; It is necessary to turn on Low 
          Dose mode there.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same camera should be selected, using either 
          the &#39;InitialCurrentCamera&#39; or &#39;AssumeCameraForDummy&#39; properties in the property 
          file or the &#39;SelectCamera&#39; script command.&nbsp; The Low Dose magnification 
          settings need not match between the offline and real settings, but the boxes 
          draw for the areas will not be the right size unless Focus and Record 
          magnifications match.&nbsp; If you are doing tilt series, you should set items as 
          Tilt Series to enable saving and editing focus.&nbsp; It is no longer necessary 
          to set them as Acquire in the offline instance, because the tilt series 
          parameters are now stored in the Navigator file.&nbsp; <em>
          If you set such items as Acquire instead, you must turn off the Acquire before saving 
          from the offline instance, because the focus positions will be lost if you turn 
          off Acquire in the real session in order to turn on Tilt Series</em>.</p>

      <P><B>Load Map</B></P>
      <P>Use this button to load in the image for a map, if the current item is a map. 
        The image will be left in the buffer used for read-in images (typically E). If 
        the map is a montage, the overview will be copied from B to this buffer. Maps 
        can be loaded regardless of whether another file is open for saving images.&nbsp; 
        If the current item is a point that was drawn on a montaged map, this button is 
        relabeled Load Piece and it will load a frame containing this point.&nbsp; If 
        the point is relatively near an edge or corner, the program will synthesize a 
        frame from 2 or 4 overlapping pieces.</P>
      <P><B><A NAME="navab_newmap"></A>New Map</B></P>
      <P>Use this button to define the current image as a map. A map consists of an 
        image that has been saved to a known file. There must be an open file to create 
        a map. If the current open file has single frames, the image in buffer A must 
        either have been saved to the file or be capable of being saved to it. If the 
        file is a montage, the image in Buffer B must be an overview from a montage 
        capture. It is possible to use an image or montage overview read in from a file 
        to make a map.&nbsp; For a single image, not all information is kept track of 
        when the image is saved and read back in, but it may work well enough if no 
        conditions have changed since the image has taken.&nbsp; For a montage, all 
        information needed for making a map is stored in the .mdoc file (as of SerialEM 
        4.6.0, Dec. 19, 2016) and this will be used instead of any current settings.&nbsp; 
        Thus, there should not be any problem making a map from a read-in montage, even 
        if the file has been closed and reopened.</P>
      <P>If the image in Buffer A has not yet been saved to a file, then the first time 
        this occurs for a particular file, you will be asked whether you want images 
        automatically saved to this file whenever you select this command. If you 
        answer yes, then the image in question will be saved, and future images will 
        also be saved provided that this file is the current file. If you answer no, 
        then each time you try to make a map without saving an image, you will be asked 
        if you want to save it to the file.</P>
    <P>The binning of the montage overview used to define the map does not affect 
      anything in the later use of the map.&nbsp; By default, montage maps are read 
      back in unbinned if possible, and you will typically want to read a map back in 
      before using it.</P>
      <P><B><A NAME="navab_anchormap"></A>Anchor Map</B></P>
      <P>This button conveniently makes an intermediate-magnification map for realigning 
        to later, such as when starting a tilt series. The button is enabled when 'For 
        anchor state' has been checked for a map that will provide a template for further 
        anchor maps. It performs the following operations:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>
          Makes a map of the current image if that seems appropriate (it is not already a 
          map, it was taken at a higher magnification than the anchor map will be taken, 
          and it would be possible to press 'New Map' successfully, either with the 
          current lyselected file or with one other open file). This is the item to 
          mark for acquisition, so that when the program realigns to this item, it will 
          align both to the anchor map and to this map image.</LI>
        <LI>
          Sets the imaging state to the state at which the item marked as 'For anchor 
          state' was acquired, and makes the file in which that map was saved be the 
          current file, opening it if necessary . This is equivalent to running <A HREF="menu_navigator.htm#hid_navigator_setacquirestate">
            Set Map Acquire State</A> from the Navigator menu or the <A HREF="hidd_statedlg.htm">
            Imaging State dialog box</A> .</LI>

          Acquires an image and makes it a map, prefixing its note with 'Anchor'.</LI>
        <LI>
          Restores the imaging state and the current file, closing the map file if it was 
          opened. This is equivalent to running <A HREF="menu_navigator.htm#hid_navigator_restorestate">
            Restore State</A> from the menu or the Imaging State dialog.</LI>
        <LI>
          Sets the current Navigator item back to the first new map that was created, or 
          to the item that was current before starting the procedure.</LI>
        <LI>
          Runs the routine to adjust coordinates for backlash if the stage is still at the 
          position of the current item and not in a known backlash-corrected state, and 
          adjusts the coordinates of both that item and the anchor map.&nbsp; This is 
          equivalent to running <A HREF="menu_navigator.htm#hid_navigator_adjust_backlash">
            Adjust for Backlash</A> from the Navigator menu.  The routine will not be run

    </OL>
      <p>
        When the current image is not saved, is at a higher magnification, and it can be 
        saved into the current file, it will be saved and made a map.&nbsp; If it cannot 
        be saved into the current file but there is one other open file that it can be 
        saved into, the program will save it into that file.&nbsp; If there is no such 
        file, it will issue a warning.&nbsp; If there is more than one other open file 
        that it could be saved into, it will ask if you want to stop and select the

        current item by cross-correlation with an appropriate map. See the <A HREF="menu_navigator.htm#hid_navigator_aligntoitem">
          Realign to Item command </A>for details.</P>
      <P><i><A NAME="nav_list_box"></A><B><FONT size="3">Item List Box</FONT></B></i></P>
      <P>The list box shows all of the items and their properties. It can be scrolled to 
        bring text into view, or the whole window can be made bigger if desired. The 
        following actions can be done in the box:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>
          Single clicking on an item will make it the current item.</LI>
        <LI>
          Double clicking on a map will load and display the map.</LI>
        <LI>
          Double clicking on a point item drawn on a montage map will load the montage 
          frame containing the point.</LI>
        <LI>
          Up and Down arrow keys will move the current selection up and down in the list, 
          as long as the main program window has the keyboard focus. Ordinarily these 
          arrow keys would pan an image up or down, but when the Navigator is open they 
          will move the list box selection instead.</LI>
        <LI>
          Items can be reordered by drag and drop; click on an item and hold the left 
          mouse button down while dragging the item to the desired place. This even works 
          when groups are collapsed to a single line.</LI></UL>
      <P>Although the box does not allow selection of multiple items by the usual Shift 
        or Ctrl clicking, a range of points can be selected for several operations by 
        pressing Shift and a key twice, once at each end of the range.&nbsp; These 
        include deleting with Shift D, toggling of 
        the acquisition state with Shift A, setting up tilt series with Shift T, and 
        setting up new files at items with Shift N.&nbsp;&nbsp; See the description of these operations under
        <a href="#navab_delete">Delete Item</a>, <a href="#navac_acquire">Acquire</a>, <A HREF="#navac_tiltseries">Tilt series</A>, 
        and <A HREF="#navac_newfile">New file at item</A>.</P>
    <P>The table can be scrolled with the mouse wheel when the mouse is over the 
      Navigator window and not over the image display window, even though the main 
      program window has the focus.&nbsp; 
      The table can also be scrolled when the dialog window has focus; however, none 
      of the hot keys for the Navigator will work then, so it best to keep the focus 
      on the main program window.&nbsp; </P>
    <P>The properties shown for each item are the label, the color, the X, Y and Z 
        coordinates, and the type of item (point, polygon, or map, 'Imp' for imported 
        map, 'Anc' for item to use for anchor map state). Next is the registration number 
        with which the item is associated. If the item is a registration point, the 
        point number is shown as well, with an entry '#R#', where the first # is the 
        registration number with which the point is associated, and the second # is the 
        unique point number for this point. Next is a cryptic summary of the 
        acquisition status of the item:</P>
      <P>C: corner point<BR>
        A: Acquire item<BR>
        AF: Acquire item at which a file it set to be opened<BR>
        AG: Acquire item and member of a group, where a new file is to be opened on the 
        first point of the group<BR>
        TS: Tilt series to be acquired<BR>
        AFS, AGS, TSS: A stored state will be set when the file is opened, or earlier 
        for a tilt series<BR>
        AP, AFP, AGP, TSP: A stored Low Dose Focus area position and subarea offset will 
          be set before the item is acquired or tilt series is started<BR>
        AFSP, AGSP, TSSP: A stored state will be set then a stored Focus position will be set,
          overriding the FOcus position in the state<BR>
      </P>
      <P>Finally, the note will appear at the end of the line.</P>
