      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_search"></A><B>Search command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command acquires an image with the Search camera parameter set, or with 
        the View camera parameters if the option <a href="#hid_camera_useviewforsearch">Use View for Search</a> 
        is selected.&nbsp; In Low Dose mode, images captured with this command are taken 
        with the separately defined Search area microscope parameters.</P>
    <P>Shortcut Key:CTRL+E</P> 
     <P><A NAME="hid_camera_view"></A><B>View command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command acquires an image with the View camera parameter set. Either this 
        set or the Search set would 
        be a good parameter set to use for binned, continuous exposures, if continuous 
        exposures work well for the particular camera.</P>
      <P>In Low Dose mode, images captured with these parameters are not shifted away 
        from the center of the recording area. The View area is intended to be set up 
        to give a low magnification, low exposure overview. The various procedures 
        which would ordinarily lower the magnification to track positions, such as the 
        eucentricity-finding routines, use View exposures in low dose mode. In other 
        words, these routines rely on the parameter set giving adequate exposures for 
        low-mag tracking in low dose mode.</P>
      <P>Shortcut Key:CTRL+V</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_focus"></A><B>Focus command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command acquires an image with the Focus camera parameter set. This 
        parameter set is used by the Autofocus routine to acquire two or three images 
        in quick succession, so it is typical to set it up for a small image that can 
        be read out quickly, such as the central quarter of the field, with somewhat 
        short exposure and drift settling times. It would be nice if one could also use 
        this parameter set for visually assessing focus, but one usually wants a larger 
        area for that purpose.</P>
      <P>In Low Dose mode, images captured with these parameters can be, and typically 
        are, shifted away from the center of the recording area.</P>
      <P>Shortcut Key:CTRL+F</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_trial"></A><B>Trial command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command acquires an image with the Trial camera parameter set. This 
        parameter set is typically set up to acquire a full-frame image relatively 
        quickly. It is used extensively by various routines that do tracking (e.g., 
        eucentricity-finding routines). You should thus make sure that this parameter 
        set gives an adequate exposure for tracking. Many of these routines actually 
        compose a separate parameter set, changing the binning and exposure time if 
        necessary so that binned images of no more than 512 pixels are acquired. 
        However, when the tilt series controller acquires tracking images, it uses the 
        Trial parameters without modification. It is recommended that you set these 
        parameters to bin images binned down to no larger than 512 pixels, and that you 
        acquire a full-frame image unless you have some specific reason not to.</P>
      <P>In Low Dose mode, images captured with these parameters can be, and typically 
        are, shifted away from the center of the recording area.</P>
      <P>Shortcut Key:CTRL+T</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_record"></A><B>Record command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command acquires an image with the Record camera parameter set. This 
        parameter set is intended to be used for final acquisition of images to be 
        saved, and the Tilt Series Controller will rely on it being set up for that 
        purpose. In addition, montaging is done by acquiring images with these 
        parameters.</P>
      <P>In Low Dose mode, images taken with these parameters define the center of the 
        recording area and can be considered unshifted.</P>
      <P>Shortcut Key:CTRL+R</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_preview"></A><B>Preview command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command acquires an image with the Preview camera parameter set. This is 
        probably useful only in Low Dose mode, where it acquires an image from the 
        Record area, using the same magnification and beam settings as for Record 
        images. It can be set up to provide a very low exposure image of the Record 
        area.

      <P>Shortcut Key:CTRL+L</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_montage"></A><B>Montage command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will start the acquisition of a montaged image, with the pieces 
        saved to file. If there is not yet an open image file, you will first enter the <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">
          Montage Setup dialog box</A>, which allows you to specify the number of 
        frames, magnification, and binning. From there, you enter the <A HREF="hidd_fileproperties.htm">
          File Properties dialog box</A> then the <A HREF="afx_hidd_filesave.htm">Save As 
          dialog box</A>.</P>
      <P>Shortcut Key:CTRL+M</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_montagetrial"></A><B>Prescan command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will acquire a binned-down montaged image, which allows a quicker 
        assessment of the area that will be captured in an actual montage. The images 
        are not saved to file. However, montaging needs to be set up first, which does 
        entail defining an output file. If montaging has not been started yet, you will 
        first enter the <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup dialog box</A>, 
        then ensuing dialogs for opening a file.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_correlationfilter_usefilterset2"></A><B>Use Filter Set 2 command (Camera - Correlation Filter submenu)</B></P>
    <P>The Correlation Filter submenu has a set of commands for controlling the filter 
      used when correlating montage overlap zones.&nbsp; There are two sets of filter 
      parameters available.&nbsp; Each set has default values, but the defaults can be 
      changed by adding entries for MontageFilterR1R2S1S2 or MontFilterSet2R1R2S1S2 to 
      the SerialEM properties file.&nbsp; The only difference between the defaults is 
      in the low frequency filtering applied when 'Treat as very sloppy montage' is 
      checked in the Montage Control panel.&nbsp; Filter Set 1 has a strong 
      low-frequency filter, which has been found to be important when there are 
      strong, high-contrast features like grid bars in the overlaps zone.&nbsp; 
      However, this amount of low-frequency filtering can be detrimental when aligning 
      low-dose montages without many features beside the regularly spaced holes.&nbsp; 
      Filter Set 2 eliminates the extra low frequency filter and may work better for 
      such specimens.</P>
    <P>Use this command to switch to Filter Set 2 unconditionally.&nbsp; If you change 
      filters and want to see the effect on alignment of an existing montage, you need 
      to turn on the <a href="#hid_correlationfilter_redocorrwhenread">Redo Corr when 
      Read</a> option so that correlations are recomputed when the montage is read in.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_correlationfilter_useset2inlowdose"></A><B>Use Set 2 in Low Dose command (Camera - Correlation Filter submenu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to switch to the second set of filter parameters for 
      correlating montage overlap zones only in Low Dose mode.&nbsp; A low 
      magnification grid map, taken outside of Low Dose mode, would use Filter Set 1, 
      which may work better for montages full of grid bars.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_correlationfilter_divideset1by2"></A><B>Divide Set 1 by 2 command (Camera - Correlation Filter submenu)</B></P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_correlationfilter_divideset2by2"></A><B>Divide Set 2 by 2 command (Camera - Correlation Filter submenu)</B></P>
    <P>Use these commands to divide all of the parameters of the first or second 
      filter set by 2.&nbsp; The filter parameters are tuned to work with a moderate 
      amount of noise in the images. When montaging in Low Dose mode, these parameters 
      will work if either the dose or the binning is high enough (typically 4 for 4K 
      camera).&nbsp; If taking images with an optimal binning for this situation is 
      not feasible or not desired, then the filter parameters can be divided by to 
      achieve an equivalent effect to doubling the binning.&nbsp; If you change this 
      selection and want to see the effect on alignment of an existing montage, you 
      need to turn on the <a href="#hid_correlationfilter_redocorrwhenread">Redo Corr 
      when Read</a> option so that correlations are recomputed when the montage is read in.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_correlationfilter_testset1values"></A><B>Test Values for Set 1 command (Camera - Correlation Filter submenu)</B></P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_correlationfilter_testset2values"></A><B>Test Values for Set 2 command (Camera - Correlation Filter submenu)</B></P>
    <P>Use these commands to try different values of the filter parameters; your 
      settings here will not be retained between sessions.&nbsp; Parameters are all 
      expressed in cycles per pixel (Nyquist is 0.5).&nbsp; Entry boxes will come up 
      for each of the four parameters in turn:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Radius 1: The <i>negative</i> of the frequency at which the low-frequency 
      filter starts to rise from 0 when the 'Treat as very sloppy montage' option is 
      on; all frequencies below this radius will be set to 0.&nbsp; Only a negative 
      value should be entered.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Radius 2: The frequency at which high-frequency filtering starts.&nbsp; 
      This may need to be lower for very noisy data.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sigma 1: The sigma for the low-frequency filter, which is an inverted 
      gaussian that rises from 0 to 1.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sigma 2: The sigma for the gaussian falloff of the high-frequency filter.&nbsp; 
      This should generally be changed proportionally if Radius 2 is changed.</P>
    <P>If you want to see the effect of new settings on an existing montage, turn on 
      the following option.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_correlationfilter_redocorrwhenread"></A><B>Redo Corr when Read command (Camera - Correlation Filter submenu)</B></P>
    <P>If you change any of the filter settings above and want to see how they work 
      with an existing montage, you need to turn on this option so that the program 
      will recompute the correlations with the new parameters when reading in the 
      montage.&nbsp; Otherwise, it will use the shifts stored in the .mdoc file 
      associated with the image file.&nbsp; In fact, with this option on, new shifts 
      will be stored in the .mdoc file every time a montage is read in.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_setcountlimit"></A><B>Set Minimum Counts command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set a minimum required number of mean counts for each 
        montage frame. When a frame is taken that falls below this limit, the program 
        stops and gives you three choices: to retake the image and test it again 
        against the limit, to save the image and go on, or to stop the montage. 
        However, if the property ShootFilmIfMontageDark is set to 1, then the program 
        will first take a film picture, which may unstick the lower shutter on a JEOL. 
        Set the minimum counts back to 0 to disable this test.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_stopacquire"></A><B>Stop Acquire command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will stop image acquisition if it is still in some intermediate 
        state, such as raising the screen or acquiring a dark reference. However, once 
        the request for an image has been issued, stopping will 
        have no effect.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_useviewforsearch"></A><B>Use View for Search command (Camera menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to hide the Search camera parameter set in the <A HREF="hidd_camerasetup.htm">Camera Setup dialog box</A>
      and use the View camera parameters for all Search acquisitions.&nbsp; In 
      Low Dose mode, Search will still use separate microscope parameters.&nbsp; Use 
      this option if you do not use Search mode in Low Dose, do not want to keep track 
      of separate View and Search cameras even if you do use Search, or if you are not 
      using Low Dose mode and want fewer radio buttons in the 
      <A HREF="hidd_camerasetup.htm">Camera Setup dialog</A>.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_userecordformontage"></A><B>No Mont. Map Params command (Camera menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to hide the Mont-map parameter set in the <A HREF="hidd_camerasetup.htm">Camera Setup dialog box</A>. 
      This parameter set could be useful when making montage maps, which often involve 
      different exposure time, binning, or other settings from Record acquisitions.&nbsp; 
      Whether a montage is made with these parameters is controlled by an option in 
      the <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup dialog box</A>. That option 
      will be disabled, and Record parameters will be used by default, if Mont-map 
      parameters are hidden with this command.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_showgainref"></A><B>Show Gain Ref command (Camera menu))</B></P>
      <P>This command will place the gain reference that was last used to normalize an 
        image into buffer A and roll the contents of A into B, etc., to the extent that 
        buffer rolling is selected. The gain reference consists of real numbers around 
        1.0 that are multiplied by the image to normalize it.
      </P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_showdarkref"></A><B>Show Dark Ref command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will place the last-used dark reference into buffer A and roll the 
        contents of A into B, etc., to the extent that buffer rolling is selected.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_postactions"></A><B>Post-actions command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command toggles a mode in which various time-consuming actions are 
        initiated immediately after camera exposure ends, at the beginning of the image 
        readout. These actions can be magnification changes, image shift, and stage 
        tilting. Stage tilting is the most noticeable action, because it means that 
        when you stop the Tilt Series Controller, it will often have already gone on to 
        the next tilt. If this behavior is problematic, you can disable it with this 
        command.&nbsp; For some cameras, the timing is too unpredictable and 
        post-actions are completely disabled.&nbsp; For Falcon and Direct Electron 
        cameras that are configured so that frames can be aligned in SerialEM, 
        post-actions are allowed only for images with such alignment, to allow them to 
        be done after the summed image is returned from the camera but before the 
        alignment is performed.&nbsp; This command will be enabled for such a camera, 
        but the post-actions will occur only when aligning frames.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_divideby2"></A><B>Divide 16-bit by 2 command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command toggles a mode in which all images from a 16-bit camera are divided 
        by 2 in the camera plugin, prior to being received by SerialEM. In this mode, 
        negative numbers in a dark-subtracted or gain-normalized image will be 
        preserved instead of truncated at zero. This could be important for 
        low-exposure images if the dark reference drifts downward.&nbsp; When this mode is selected, the options for treatment of 16-bit data in 
        the <A HREF="hidd_fileproperties.htm">File Properties dialog box</A> will be 
        disabled because they are no longer relevant. (The image has already been 
        divided by 2 and will not be recognized as an unsigned 16-bit image.)</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_normalizehere"></A><B>Normalize Here command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command toggles the processing (dark subtraction and gain normalization) of 
        images within SerialEM. This setting is initially determined by the global 
        'GainNormalizeInSerialEM' property or by the 'NormalizeInSerialEM' property for 
        individual cameras. When it is off, processed images are acquired from 
        the camera interface. When it is on, raw images and 
        dark references are acquired from the camera, and the processing is done in 
        SerialEM. In the case of Gatan cameras, the gain reference could come from 
        DigitalMicrograph or from one prepared in SerialEM, depending on which exists.</P>
    <P>This command is disabled either because normalized images cannot be obtained 
      from the interface for the current camera, or because normalization is always 
      done by the camera software for the particular camera.&nbsp; The latter is the 
      case when the normalization by that software is more sophisticated than what can 
      be done in SerialEM, or when it is important to have the camera acquire 
      normalized images to enable other functionality (e.g., for using drift 
      correction with a OneView camera).</P>
    <P>For Tietz F216, F416, and XF416 cameras, normalized images can be acquired from 
      the camera by adding a property &#39;TietzFlatfieldDir&#39; specifying the directory 
      where the TVIPS flatfield images are located.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_interpolate_dark_refs"></A><B>Interpolate Dark Refs command 
          (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command toggles whether the program will compute a dark reference for a 
        particular exposure time by interpolating between dark references for two other 
        exposure times, instead of taking a dark reference to match each exposure. When 
        this feature is enabled, interpolation is used if the desired exposure time is 
        between the times for two existing references separated by no more than 0.2 
        second. If such references do not exist, a new reference is taken either at the 
        desired exposure time or at an interval of 0.2 seconds from a nearby reference; 
        in the latter case interpolation can then be used. The interpolated dark 
        reference will be at least as accurate as a reference taken to match a 
        particular exposure, because interpolation averages over two estimates of the 
        reference. Thus, it is not necessary to take averaged dark references to get 
        good interpolated references, although averaging will improve the estimate 
        further.</P>
      <P>When exposure time is being varied automatically during a tilt series, the 
        program activates interpolation if possible. However, this feature is available 
        only when gain normalization is being done in SerialEM.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_camera_setframealignlines"></A><B>Set Frame Align Lines command (Camera menu)</B></P>
    <P>This command allows you to control how much detail is printed to the log window 
      after K2 frame alignment done in the SerialEMCCD plugin to DM.&nbsp; The default 
      is two lines of output: one with the raw and smoothed movement distance implied 
      by the frame shifts; one with selected residual values.&nbsp; If enough frames 
      are included when fitting the shifts to allow robust fitting, the residuals 
      given are the average of the weighted mean residuals of the fits (an overall 
      figure of merit), the maximum over the fits of the maximum weighted residuals in 
      each fit (reflecting the worse frame alignment result), and the maximum of 
      maximum unweighted residuals(reflecting the occurrence of bad alignments that 
      could be discarded as outliers).&nbsp; With no robust fitting, it simply shows 
      the overall mean residual and maximum of maximum residuals.</P>
    <P>When you select to show one line, it will show the overall mean residual and 
      maximum of maximum residuals, based on weighted values if there is robust 
      fitting, plus the raw distance moved.</P>
    <P>When you select to show three lines, it will compute the Fourier ring 
      correlation (FRC) between sums of even and odd frames and report the frequencies 
      values at which it falls below various levels, plus the FRC at half-Nyquist.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_camera_settiming"></A><B>Set Timing command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command allows you to enter values for the startup delay, minimum drift 
        settling, and extra beam time needed in the dual shuttering mode of operation. 
        The option is enabled by being in Administrator mode.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_camera_set_quality"></A><B>Set Quality command (Camera menu)</B></P>
    <P>This command allows you to enter a value for the quality level to set when 
      acquiring images in continuous mode from the current Gatan camera.&nbsp; Enter a 
      number between 1 and 7 (most camaeras will not have that many quality levels), 
      or enter 0 to have no quality value set.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_camera_setscanning"></A><B>Set Scanning command (Camera menu)</B></P>
    <P>This command was used to enter parameters to control beam movement and focus 
      changes while scanning with a slit beam.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_setcorrections"></A><B>Set Corrections command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command allows you to enter a value for the basic corrections to be done 
        when DigitalMicrograph acquires an image. This value may initially be set with 
        the 'BasicCorrections' property, otherwise it is -1, meaning that default 
        corrections will be done. The value should be the sum of 1 for defect 
        correction, 16 for bias correction, and 32 for linearization. 0 will turn off 
        all default corrections. This command is enabled by being in Administrator 
        mode.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_setdriftinterval"></A><B>Set Drift Interval command (Camera 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>It is possible for drift to be compensated during an exposure by using a script 
        command to set the drift rate for the next exposure. This command is used to 
        adjust the interval between changes in image shift during the exposure. The 
        default is 100 ms, which may be too short on a JEOL.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_screendown"></A><B>Screen Down command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command is used to toggle a mode in which the screen is not raised before a 
        camera exposure. This could be useful for looking at the beam during an 
        exposure.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_camera_nonormofdsdosefrac"></A><B>No Norm of DS Dose Frac command (Camera menu)</B></P>
    <P>This command can be used to turn off the normalization of the summed image that 
      is returned from a K2 dose fractionation shot taken without gain normalization.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_simulation"></A><B>Simulation command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command is used to toggle simulation mode, in which fake images are 
        produced within SerialEM rather than acquired from DigitalMicrograph. It should 
        not be needed for simulation if DigitalMicrograph is started with Ctrl and 
        Shift held down to activate the Faux camera.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_camera_debugmode"></A><B>Debug Mode command (Camera menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command is used to toggle debug mode, in which the SerialEMCCD plugin will 
        chronicle its transactions in the DigitalMicrograph Results window. The camera 
        controller in SerialEM will also output some timing information in the Log 
        Window. After turning on this mode, you can debug problems with taking a 
        picture with the following procedure:</P>
      <P style="Z-INDEX: 0">Be sure that the Results window is open in DigitalMicrograph.</P>
      <P style="Z-INDEX: 0">Try to take an image of the kind that makes&nbsp;an error 
        occur.
      </P>
      <P style="Z-INDEX: 0">Go to the DigitalMicrograph Results window. At the end will 
        be the last script executed. Open a new script window with Ctrl-K. Copy from
