    <P>SerialEM presents an integrated environment for image acquisition, display, and 
      storage, as well as for the control of the microscope needed to acquire 
      montaged images and tilt series. You can acquire images from a variety of cameras 
      using parameters that you set from within SerialEM. Images can be zoomed, 
      panned, and compared with each other using controls similar to those in Imod. 
      Successive images are conveniently saved to a single MRC file, ready for 
      display in Imod. The Tilt Series Controller will acquire a tilt series 
      automatically using a prediction algorithm to minimize acquisition time and 
      specimen exposure. A low dose mode can be used to perform focusing and tracking 
      away from the area of interest. SerialEM can also automatically capture a 
      montage of overlapping frames, and acquire a montaged tilt series. The program 
      also contains a script feature for programming repetitive actions.</P>
    <P><B><I>Controls:</I></B> SerialEM is controlled through its menus, control 
      panels, and hotkeys. Menus contain commands related to a topic, as well as some 
      entries to set parameters related to that topic. The control panels provide 
      status information, buttons for performing all frequently used operations, and 
      buttons for setting parameters related to the particular panel. Here is some 
      general information about <A HREF="about_panels.htm">Control Panels</A>. 
      Hotkeys are summarized in the section on <A HREF="about_mouse.htm">Mouse and 
        Keyboard Controls</A>.</P>
    <P><B><I>Buffers and display windows:</I></B> Images are initially displayed in a 
      main image display window. Images are kept in a set of buffers, and the main 
      display window can show an image from any one of these buffers. Similarly to 
      Imod, you can riffle through the images with PageUp and PageDn. The buffers are 
      referred to by letter. Images from the camera are always placed in buffer A, 
      the first buffer. The program is typically set up to roll images through the 
      first three buffers. In other words, when a new image comes in, the existing 
      image in buffer A is moved to buffer B, the image previously in buffer B is 
      moved to buffer C, and the image in buffer C is lost.</P>
    <P>It is also possible to copy an image to a new, free-standing window, which could 
      be useful if you want to look at two images side by side.</P>
    <P><B><I>Camera control:</I></B> The camera controls are patterned after those 
      available in DigitalMicrograph, but there are some important enhancements that 
      provide more flexible control of the specimen exposure, make it easier to 
      select subareas of the camera, and allow control of whether a dark reference is 
      taken. General information about image capture is available in the section on <A HREF="about_camera.htm">
        Image Acquisition</A>.</P>
    <P><B><I>File storage:</I></B> When images are saved to a file, successive images 
      are typically stacked into a single file in the MRC format. The pixel size is 
      set in the header, and tilt angle and other information can be stored in the 
      extended header area. The file header is maintained after every image is 
      stored, so that the file will be readable if something goes wrong.</P>
    <P><B><I>Image alignment:</I></B> Alignment of images is a key component of data 
      collection. SerialEM provides a linkage between the shifting of an image in a 
      window, which is referred to as an alignment shift, and the physical 
      realization of this shift using the image shift feature of the microscope. This 
      means that if you want to center a particular feature in the camera frame, you 
      can impose an alignment shift on an image that has already been acquired, 
      simply by dragging it with the right mouse button. The microscope image shift 
      is then changed by the right amount so that the next image that you acquire 
      appears in the desired place. Two images can also be aligned to each other by 
      cross-correlation. This is referred to as autoaligning. The image in buffer A 
      is correlated to a reference image in another buffer. Before doing this 
      correlation, the program will stretch the image taken at a higher tilt angle to 
      give a better match to the other image.</P>
    <P><B><I>Autofocusing:</I></B> SerialEM determines the defocus of the specimen by 
      the standard technique of measuring how much the image moves when the beam is 
      tilted. When the specimen is in the focal plane, its image does not move; and 
      the farther it is from focus, the bigger the beam-tilt induced movement. For 
      this to work correctly, you need to align the beam tilt pivot points properly, 
      a standard step in the Direct Alignments used to tune the microscope. Be sure 
      that the specimen is at the eucentric height and at minimum contrast focus when 
      you tune the pivot points. They do not need to be perfect, but do need to be 
      close. Measurement of defocus is typically done by taking a picture with 
      positive beam tilt, one with negative beam tilt, then another with positive 
      beam tilt. Having three pictures allows the program to compensate for drift. 
      Once the program has measured the defocus, it can change it to achieve the 
      level of defocus that you specify. This procedure is called autofocusing.</P>
