    <P><A NAME="hidd_buffercontrol"></A><B><FONT size="3">Buffer Control Panel</FONT></B></P>
    <P>This panel contains controls for copying images from one buffer to another, 
      saving images to file, and setting options that govern how buffers are treated 
      during image acquisition and storage.</P>
    <P><B>Copy Active Image to Buffer</B></P>
    <P>This row of buttons will copy the active image to another buffer. The active 
      image is either the current image in the main window, or the image in a 
      secondary window, if there is a secondary window that has the input focus 
      (title bar highlighted rather than gray). The first four buttons from the left 
      will copy to buffers A through D, respectively. The fifth button has a spin 
      button control to allow you to dial up any other buffer in the program. The 
      'New' button will copy the image into a new secondary image window.</P>
    <P><B>SAVE A</B></P>
    <P>This button will save the image in buffer A to a file. If there is no image file 
      open yet, you will first enter the <A HREF="hidd_fileproperties.htm">File 
        Properties</A> and <A HREF="afx_hidd_filesave.htm">Save As dialog boxes</A> 
      to specify a file. This file will become the open image file, available for 
      further saving.</P>
    <P><B>Save Active Image</B></P>
    <P>This button will save the active image to a file. The active image is either the 
      current image in the main window, or the image in a secondary window, if there 
      is a secondary window that has the input focus (title bar highlighted rather 
      than gray). If there is no image file open yet, you will first enter the <A HREF="hidd_fileproperties.htm">
        File Properties</A> and <A HREF="afx_hidd_filesave.htm">Save As dialog boxes</A>
      to specify a file. This file will become the open image file, available for 
      further saving.</P>
    <P><B>To file # spin button</B></P>
    <P>This control can be used to switch from one open image file to another. The name 
      of the current file is always displayed in the program's title bar, and if there 
      are multiple files open, their names will also be shown after their file numbers. Montaging 
      will be activated or deactivated as appropriate for the file being switched to. 
      If you switch between files when a tilt series is stopped, the correct file 
      will be selected again when you resume.</P>
    <P><B>Memory usage output</B></P>
    <P>The line with 'Memory = xx MB' shows a summary of the program's memory usage for 
      all image data, including viewable images in buffers and gain and dark 
      references.</P>
    <P><B>Roll Buffers spin button</B></P>
    <P>This control governs how many images are preserved by being moved to higher 
      buffers when a new image is acquired. For example, if the panel says 'Roll 
      Buffers A -&gt; C', then when a new image is acquired, the image in A will be 
      moved to B, the image in B moved to C, and the image in C deleted. (An 
      exception to this occurs when the image in A was acquired in a continuous 
      acquisition.) The up and down arrows will increase and decrease the number of 
      images rolled through the buffers, respectively.</P>
    <P><B>Delete</B></P>
    <P>Use this button to delete the image in the current buffer when the main window 
      is active. Deleting large images will help when the program begins to run out 
      of memory.</P>
    <P><B>Autoalign to B</B></P>
    <P>Ordinarily, an image in buffer A is autoaligned to the image in the buffer after 
      the last rolling buffer, which means that a reference image placed there will 
      be preserved as new images are taken. With this option selected, images will be 
      aligned to buffer B instead, which allows successive images to be aligned to 
      each other without copying one to another buffer.</P>
    <P><B>Read Buffer spin button</B></P>
    <P>This control governs what buffer images are placed into when they are read from 
      a file. If you never use this control, the Read Buffer will be maintained to be 
      two buffers past the last rolling buffer, or three buffers when in low dose 
      mode. Thus, changing the number of buffers to roll, or going into or out of low 
      dose mode, will generally change the Read Buffer. However, if you select a 
      different buffer to read into with this control, then these automatic changes 
      may not occur.</P>
    <P><B>Protect unsaved Record images</B></P>
    <P>Selecting this option will protect images acquired with the Record parameter set 
      from being deleted if they have not been saved to file. You will have to 
      confirm that you want to delete such an image.</P>
