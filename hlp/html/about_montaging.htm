      <P>Montaging allows one to capture an array of multiple, overlapping frames
        automatically using either electronic image shift or stage movement. Each such
        frame is called a piece. Pieces are numbered and referred to by their position
        in X and Y within the montaged image (numbered from 1) and by their section
        number or Z value (numbered from 0). For example, in the first set of images
        making up a 2 by 3 montage, piece 2, 2 is the middle piece in the right column,
        and the Z value would be 0. All pieces in a montaged image have the same Z
        value.</P>
      <P>Montaging can be initiated in several ways: by selecting New Montage or Montage
        Parameters from the File menu, by selecting Montage or Prescan from the Camera
        menu, or by pressing the Start or Prescan buttons in the <A HREF="hidd_montagecontrol.htm">
          Montage Control panel</A> . Whichever way is used, you will then encounter
        a series of dialog boxes: the <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup dialog
          box</A> for defining the montage size, <A HREF="hidd_fileproperties.htm">File
          Properties dialog</A> for specifying how images are stored, and the <A HREF="afx_hidd_filesave.htm">
          Save As dialog box</A> to specify the output file. Montaging can also be
        restarted on an existing file simply by reopening that file. In this case, you
        will enter the <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup dialog box</A> to
        see the parameters governing the montage, but you will not be able to change
        most parameters.</P>
      <P>You should always calibrate the image shift at the given magnification before
        starting to acquire montages for a tilt series. See the <A HREF="menu_calibration.htm#hid_calibration_imageshift">
          Image Shift command</A> in the Calibrate menu.</P>
      <P>When montaging is started, the <A HREF="hidd_montagecontrol.htm">Montage Control
          panel</A> opens up. At that point, a montage can be acquired by pressing
        the Start button there or the Montage button in the <A HREF="hidd_camera_macro.htm">
          Camera &amp; Script Control panel</A>, or by using the Ctrl M hotkey or the
        entry in the Camera menu. Images are always acquired with the 'Record' camera
        parameters.</P>
      <P>The Prescan option, available in control panels and the Camera menu, will
        acquire binned down images at all piece positions and use them to compose an
        overview image. These images are acquired relatively quickly and are not saved
        to file, so this is a good way to find out what features are included in a
        montaged area without taking actual montages.
      </P>
      <P>To acquire a montage, the program shifts to each of the frames and acquires and
        saves an image. As it goes, it composes an 'overview' image, a single, binned
        down image of the entire montaged area. This image is left in buffer B. The
        different pieces may not be shifted into perfect registration when composing
        the overview, so this image may show some sharp transitions between the pieces.
        This should not be a cause for concern. There is an option in the <A HREF="hidd_montagecontrol.htm">
          Montage Control panel</A> to have pieces shifted into register instead.
      </P>
      <P>You can use the right mouse button to impose an alignment shift on an overview
        image to reposition the field of view.</P>
      <P>As it acquires frames, the program also uses cross-correlation to measure the
        misregistration between each pair of overlapping pieces. When the whole montage
        has been acquired, it uses these errors in registration to determine how to
        shift all of the pieces so as to minimize the error. The program informs you in
        the Log window of the error before and after shifting pieces into best
        registration. The error before shifting can become high (more than 10 pixels)
        if there is drift during the acquisition or if image shift is not well
        calibrated. The error after shifting should be low (under 0.5 pixel) at low
        tilt angles, but may become relatively high (1-4 pixels) at high tilt because
        image distortions prevent pieces from fitting together well. A high error can
        also occur if there is an error in the correlation between some pair of pieces.
        The latter problem can be corrected afterwards in Midas. Another possible
        source for a relatively high error is distortion in the images. It is possible
        to correct this in IMOD also by measuring the image distortion field.</P>
      <P>After acquiring a montage, the program also composes a 'center' image and leaves
        it in Buffer A. For a montage with an odd number of pieces in X and Y, this
        would just be the center piece, but in other cases it composes this image from
        halves of two overlapping pieces or from quarters of four overlapping pieces.
        The misregistrations between pieces are taken into account in fitting these
        pieces together, so the center image should not show sharp transitions and
        should be suitable for aligning from one tilt to the next.</P>
      <P>You can reconstruct the overview and center pieces for a stored montage by
        simply selecting the Read command from the File menu. The program will go
        through the same sequence of operations using each piece from the file that it
        does with newly acquired pieces, leaving a center image in buffer A and an
        overview in buffer B and in the Read buffer.</P>
      <P>If the range of image shift required to make a montage is large, you can use
        stage movements instead. This is specified by an option in the <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">
          Montage Setup dialog box</A>. Montages constructed with stage movement are
        useful for getting an image of a large area but will not fit together very well
        unless the option is selected to have pieces shifted into register. It may also
        be necessary to select the option to allow for very sloppy montages by
        correlating larger areas in the overlap zones. If there are grid bars in the
        overlap zones between images, the correlations can easily fail and either of
        these options may make things worse.</P>
      <P>When montages are acquired with stage movement, it is possible to resume a
        montage that is stopped for some reason. To resume a montage, just start the
        montage by any of the usual means. The program will ask if you want to resume
        it or redo it completely. By default, it will restart where it left off.
        However, if you see that some images are bad and want to have them reacquired,
        select the <A HREF="menu_file.htm#hid_file_overwrite">Overwrite Pieces command</A>
        in the File menu. Enter the number of pieces to be replaced.</P>
      <P><B>Acquiring High-Quality Montages of Large Areas</B></P>
      <P>Montages of large areas generally need to be taken with stage movement. If you
        are acquiring such montages for image analysis or 3D reconstruction rather than
        just for an overview or mapping in the Navigator, then you will want
        high-quality images. The <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup dialog box</A>
        allows you to enable a collection of settings for a high-quality stage montage.
        For a substantial data collection effort, you may need to experiment with these
        settings to find which ones you need.</P>
      <P>Focusing is important for large montages. There is an option to run the
        autofocus routine on every frame. However, this is probably not necessary in
        many cases. For example, if the sample is locally tilted by 1&deg;, then the Z
        height and thus the focus will change by only 0.18 &micro;m over a
        distance of 10 &micro;m.
        Thus, there is also an option to acquire the montage in successive square
        blocks of images, focusing only in the center of each block. On a Thermo/FEI scope, this
        should save significant amounts of time. On a JEOL, the time savings may be
        less because of the slower stage and it may result in more variable overlaps
        between adjacent pieces.</P>
      <P>If there is enough drift after a stage movement to impair the quality of the
        images, you may need to increase the delay between stage movement and image
        acquisition.&nbsp; In addition, if you are focusing for each piece, you can
        select an option to have it repeat the autofocus if the drift is higher than a
        selected limit.</P>
      <P>To deal with the problems of&nbsp;persistent stage drift over long periods of
        time as well as irregularities in stage movement, the program can
        realign&nbsp;to an existing piece with image shift before acquiring&nbsp;each
        piece.&nbsp; This procedure has proven capable of producing a stage montage
        with&nbsp;very little variability in the overlaps between pieces, which allows
        the overlap to be kept at 10% or even reduced to as low as 5%.&nbsp; In
        addition to dealing with drift, this realignment can overcome the&nbsp;effects
        of cyclical variations in compustage movement, documented by Pulokas et al.,
        1999.&nbsp; Over a certain range of image sizes (around 4 microns), these
        effects can be large enough&nbsp;to&nbsp;cause inadequate&nbsp;overlap between
        adjacent pieces unless the nominal overlap is set very&nbsp;high
        (20-25%).&nbsp; This option can thus be useful not only for very large montages
        but also for modest-sized montages&nbsp;with piece sizes in this
        range.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recommended that the option be used for
        acquiring&nbsp;a medium-magnification map upon which supermontages are to be
        placed, because it is important for such maps to have well-aligned pieces.&nbsp;
        Additionally, the Navigator can use information about the stage positions of the
        individual pieces to achieve more precise positioning when moving to or
        realigning to a position marked on a map acquired with this method.&nbsp; Thus,
        it can be advantageous to use this method for other medium-magnification maps,
        provided that the realignment works reliably with your specimen and that the
        increased acquisition time is acceptable.</P>
      <P style="Z-INDEX: 0">With image shift realignment, pieces can be acquired in
        two&nbsp;different sequences.&nbsp; One is the ordinary sequence, in columns
        starting at the lower left and finishing at the upper right.&nbsp; This
        sequence is appropriate as long as the entire area being montaged contains
        image features suitable for correlation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other sequence starts
        at the center and works outward.&nbsp; This sequence should be chosen if the
        edges of the area contain problematic features such as empty resin or grid
        bars.&nbsp; With such a sequence, alignment failures on peripheral pieces will
        not throw off the alignment of the more central pieces where the material of
        interest is.&nbsp; This sequence does require that the program realign to a
        lower-magnification image between the first and second halves of the
        montage.&nbsp; For more details, see the description of these options in the
        help for the <A href="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup dialog box</A>.</P>
      <P>There is an option to skip the correlations needed to shift pieces into
        register. These correlations are of no real value if the data are to be
        processed elsewhere and can consume significant time in a large acquisition.</P>
      <P>In stage montages, the effects of backlash are minimized by always moving the
        stage to a piece position from the same direction. For each column of pieces to
        be acquired, there is a backlash correction movement in the opposite direction.
        The amount of this correction is set by the property StageMontageBacklash,
        which defaults to 5 &micro;m on a Thermo/FEI scope, 10 &micro;m on a JEOL, and
        20 &micro;m on the Hitachi HT7700. With JEOL stages, a
        value of 20-25 &micro;m may be needed to reduce variability in the overlaps. To
        determine the needed value, take a small montage (e.g., 5 x 5) and process it
        in IMOD as described below. After running blendmont, open the file in midas and
        compare the overlaps between the first and second piece in each column with the
        overlaps between pieces higher in Y. Much lower overlap between the first and
        second piece in each column indicate more backlash correction is needed, but a
        point will be reached where additional correction does not improve the
        overlaps.</P>
      <P>Regions of a plastic section that have not previously been exposed will undergo
        rapid changes under the beam that may impair the quality of the first image
        taken there. Thus, areas to be imaged should be pre-exposed. Fortunately the
        required dose is much less than for tomography, around 5-10 electrons per
        square Angstrom. This can be achieved by irradiating the whole area for a few
        minutes with a bright beam at low magnification.</P>
      <P><B>Processing a Montage in IMOD</B></P>
      <P>If you have acquired a tilt series, it is ready to process with eTomo in IMOD,
        and the Tomography Guide describes the steps that are special for working with
        a montage. Otherwise, if you want to work with the montaged images, you should
        process it with the interface for aligning serial sections and blending montages
        in eTomo in order to get a single blended image out of
        each montage. This is preferable to saving the overview image, because
        the blending program in IMOD, Blendmont, does a better job than SerialEM of shifting the pieces into optimal
        positions and it can produce seamless transitions between pieces. This interface
        is available in IMOD version 4.7 or higher.</P>
    <P>If you just want to blend some isolated images (i.e., not serial sections to
      align), the procedure is fairly simple.&nbsp; You may be able to get through it
      without reading more detailed instructions by following these steps:</P>
    <ol>
      <li>Place the file to be blended into a directory for the computations.&nbsp; If
        you want to reuse a directory where you have blended before and you do not care
        to revisit the earlier blend, remove any existing &#39;.ess&#39; file from the
        directory.</li>
      <li>Open a terminal and cd to that directory.</li>
      <li>Start etomo</li>
      <li>Select <b>Align Serial Sections / Blend Montages</b>.</li>
      <li>Press the file chooser icon on the <b>Stack</b> line and select the image
        file.</li>
      <li>Switch to <b>Montage</b> and press <b>OK</b>.</li>
      <li>Select <b>Treat as very sloppy montage</b> if the montage was taken with stage
        movement instead of image shift</li>
      <li>Select <b>Robust fitting</b> if it is a low magnification map with grid bars
        or extensive regions off the edge of the grid.</li>
      <li>Press <b>Make Blended Stack</b>.&nbsp; This will create a file named with the
        root name of the original image file plus &#39;_preblend.mrc&#39;.</li>
      <li>When it is done, press <b>Open Blended Stack</b>.</li>
    </ol>
    <P>&nbsp;For more complicated situations, or if that fails, here are some general
        instructions for processing the file in IMOD, which refer you to the more
      extensive help available there.</P>
      <P>The montage is stored as individual frames in the MRC file. The MRC file has the
        coordinates of the frames in its extended header, unless the coordinates are
        too large to be stored there, in which case they are stored in a 'metadata
        autodoc' file whose name is the name of the image file with the extension
        '.mdoc'. If there is a '.mdoc' file associated with your image file, be sure to
        keep it together with the image file for processing.
      </P>
      <P>If your file is named 'filename.st' and the coordinates are stored only in the
        &#39;.mdoc&#39; file, first extract the list of piece coordinates into
        a file 'filename.pl' with:</P>
      <P>extractpieces -mdoc filename.st filename.pl</P>
      <P>If you run 'header' on the image file in IMOD, the image size will show up as
        the size of the pieces and the number of pieces will be given for the number of
        sections. There is a program, 'montagesize', that can be run on a file to find
        out the actual size of the montage and the number of sections. You can run this
        as</P>
      <P>montagesize filename.st</P>
      <P>or, if the coordinates had to be extracted from an 'mdoc' file,</P>
      <P>montagesize filename.st filename.pl</P>
      <P>Run:</P>
    <P>imodhelp</P>
    <P>and select the topic &#39;Serial Section Alignment and Montage Blending&#39;.&nbsp;
      Read the sections &#39;Getting Started&#39; and &#39;Blending Montaged Images&#39; and follow
      the directions there.</P>
      <P>The blending operation can be partially parallelized by splitting it into
        chunks. Run 'imodhelp splitblend' for details.&nbsp; This cannot be done through
        the eTomo interface, but you can start the final blend, immediately kill it,
        then run splitblend on the file &#39;blend.com&#39;.</P>
