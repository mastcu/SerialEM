      <P>Use this command to set up a montage to capture the area within the current set
        of corner points. The following description applies to this command and next two 
        that involve fitting a montage to an area.&nbsp; Outside of Low Dose, be sure to go to the desired magnification before activating
        this command.&nbsp; In Low Dose mode, the program will use the pre-existing 
        settings of the &#39;Use View in Low Dose Mode&#39; and &#39;Use Search in Low Dose mode&#39; options to 
        determine how to fit the area.&nbsp; If it finds that the fit requires too many 
        pieces, it will switch to a mode with a larger field of view.&nbsp; More likely, 
        it will open anyway with the wrong area selected and you will have to change 
        this selection.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;You will be opening a new image file for the montage, so if there
        is already a file open the program will ask whether you want to close it. The
        program will compute the number of montage frames in X and Y required to
        capture the area, and decide whether the montage should be acquired with image
        shift or stage movements. If the area of the Record parameter set is
        substantially smaller than the camera field, you will be asked whether you want
        the frame size to be kept smaller than the current Record area. You might want
        this if the beam is too small to fill the whole camera field. Otherwise, the
        program will make the frames as large as possible. Unless there are too many
        frames, you will then go on to the <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup
          dialog box</A>, in which you will see the number of frames and their size
        and overlap. If the size of the montage is not reasonable (e.g., bigger than
        20K by 20K pixels), outside of Low Dose you can change the magnification to adjust the number of
        frames and achieve the desired image size.&nbsp; In Low Dose mode, you can 
      only switch to using View or Search mode instead. You can also adjust the percentage
        overlap, which may also change the number of frames needed to fit the desired
        area. Once you have set up a reasonable montage, go on to the <A HREF="hidd_fileproperties.htm">

      <P>Use this command to set up a montage to capture the whole grid area. A set of
        points will be composed that contain the grid area. The command then works the
        same as the <A HREF="#hid_corner_montage">Setup Corner Montage command</A>, 
        except that in Low Dose mode, it will automatically switch to using the current

        than the other area.&nbsp; 
        After the montage is acquired and displayed, if the Navigator is open, you will likely see a dashed red 
        rectangle indicating the limits of stage movement.&nbsp; Note that if there are 
        image shift offset calibrations, the coordinates of the red rectangle are based 
        on the offset-adjusted stage coordinates that the Navigator uses.&nbsp; This 
        means that you may not be able to get to all positions within the rectangle at 
        the low magnification of the grid map, but you will be able to get to them at a 
        magnification closer to the one that is the basis for the offset adjustment.</P>

      <P>Use this command to enter lower and upper limits in X and Y for the full grid 
        montage.&nbsp; Specifically, these limits will be used to construct the polygon 
        that is fit when setting up the full montage, but not to limit the stage 
        positions visited to acquire a montage covering that polygon.&nbsp; Actual stage 
        movement can be limited only by the &#39;StageLimits&#39; property in the 
        SerialEMproperties.txt file, and this property, not the setting here, determines 
        the coordinates of the dashed red rectangle that will be drawn on images that 
        extend beyond the limits when the Navigator is open.</P>
      <P>A dialog box will come up for each limit; enter the desired limit in
        microns or 0 to use the default limit that is shown, which is the property-based limit
        that can be modified with 'StageLimits'.&nbsp; If you
        enter a number bigger than one of the defaults, you may get farther out to the
        corners of the usable area, but the stage will still not be moved beyond the property-based
        stage limits.&nbsp; If you want access to the full range of motion on a JEOL scope, you
        need to enter or change the &#39;StageLimits&#39; property to be &#39;-1190 1190 -1190 1190&#39;

        Navigator file when there is either no multiple grid session or no grid maps 
        available in a session.&nbsp; The command is thus useful for a different style 
        of working, where multiple grid maps are all in one file at different 
        registrations.&nbsp; In this case, the program looks for the lowest 
        magnification at which maps were obtained, in LM only, and loads as many maps 
        taken at that magnification as possible.&nbsp; In either case, it will load the 
        maps in buffers past the read buffer if possible, and thus ordinarily past the 
        rolling buffers, but they may start in lower buffers if necessary to fit all the 
        maps. If this does not fit your needs, the script command 'LoadAllGridMaps' 
        allows you to specify the starting buffer to load into.&nbsp; Once all these 
        maps are loaded, it is tempting to add points to any one of them, but this would 
        often result in points in the wrong Navigator file.&nbsp; As long as the <a href="hidd_multi_grid.htm">Multiple Grid 
        Operations</a> dialog is open, the program will prevent adding points to a map 
        that is not in the table for the open Navigator file.&nbsp; When you try to do

        points at a defined spacing to fill a polygon or map. For the first two kinds,
        the position of the lattice is specified by a group of 5 points, three at

      <P>To make all of the points be in one group, press the 'Add points' button and
        mark all 5 points before pressing 'Stop Adding'. As long as one of the points
        is the current item, you can select this command. The program will then ask for
        the label of a polygon that you want to fill. If you leave the text box blank,
        it will create points for all positions in the rectangle indicated by the corners.
        If you enter a valid label for a polygon that contains the points
        (specifically, the centroid of the points), then it will add points to fill the
        polygon, extending the rectangle beyond the corners that you have marked if
        necessary.&nbsp; If you are filling an elongated region, you can reduce errors
        from extrapolation by marking the corner with two adjacent points near the
        middle of the region instead of near one end.</P>
    <P>For a large grid, it may be difficult to mark the two adjacent points
      accurately enough to end up with the right number of points between them and the
      endpoint.&nbsp; You can overcome this with a group of 7 points, where the points
      along one axis would look like</P>
    <P>X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>X</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X</P>
    <P>and similarly along the other axis.&nbsp; The additional point between the
      adjacent pair and the endpoint (<b>X</b>) allows it to get a more accurate
      initial estimate of the interval between points, so that when it divides the
      longer distance by this interval and rounds to the nearest integer, it comes out
      with the right number. Placing this point at the square root of the total number
      of points along the line should be optimal (e.g, at the fifth point if there are
      25).&nbsp; (The additional point needs to be far enough out to give a
      sufficiently accurate initial estimate but not so far that it mis-estimates the
      number of points along the line to that point.)&nbsp; If you start with a
      5-point group and the placement fails, you can add the two points to the same
      group by turning on Edit mode, selecting any point in the group with the left
      mouse button, and adding the two intermediate points with the middle mouse
      button.</P>
    <P>Once you have added a grid with a 5- or 7-point pattern like this, you can add a grid
      in a new area with the same spacing and orientation by simply adding a single
      point in the new area.&nbsp; It must be the only point in the group, so press
      'Add points', add the point, and press 'Stop Adding'.&nbsp; If you are not
      filling a polygon, the point should be at the same corner of the region to fill
      as the corner of the 5-point pattern with two adjacent points.&nbsp; If you are
      filling a polygon, the program will test for whether either this point itself, or
        the center of the grid that would extend from that point as its corner, is in
        the polygon.&nbsp; Thus, you can put the point near the middle of the polygon to reduce
      extrapolation errors.&nbsp; (The test for the point itself being in the polygon
        was added in SerialEM 3.7.4).</P>
      <P>To add a line of points, simply add a group of three points to indicate the
        extent and spacing of the line, such as:</P>
      <P>X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o &nbsp;&nbsp; o
        &nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp; &nbsp; o &nbsp;&nbsp; o &nbsp;&nbsp; X</P>
      <P>As long as one of these points is the current item, the command will be
        available and will add a line of points between the endpoints.</P>
      <P>Finally, to add equally spaced points within a polygon or map but not on a
        defined lattice, simply make the polygon or map be the current item and select
        this command. Then enter the desired spacing in microns.&nbsp; Alternatively, 
        keep one of the points in the group as the current item and start this command.&nbsp; 
        You will be asked to identify a polygon or map to fill with the grid, either by 
        the item&#39;s label or by the negative of the item&#39;s index in the table.&nbsp; </P>
      <P>When adding points to fill a polygon or the rectangle of&nbsp;a map, the points
        will not be placed right up against the border of the polygon. Rather, a square
        box around each point is required to be fully within the polygon. The size of
        this box as a fraction of the spacing between points is controlled by the
        GridInPolygonBoxFraction property, whose default value is 0.75.</P>
      <P>Grid points can be added in two different patterns. One is a zigzag path, in which
        points go in alternating directions between successive rows or columns.
        This was originally the only pattern in SerialEM and was designed to
        minimize stage movement when moving between points. The other pattern goes in
        the same direction in each row and column, and proceeds in an overall direction
        away from the location of the Focus area in Low Dose mode. This pattern ensures
        that focusing is done in areas that have already been acquired from.&nbsp;
        However, this pattern is not used when added points are placed into separate
        groups.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_montaginggrids_addgridlikelastone"></A><B>Add Grid Like Last One command (Navigator
          - Montaging &amp; Grids sub-menu)</B></P>
       <P>After adding a grid of points with the previous command, you can use this command
           to add another grid of the same kind without having to answer any queries.&nbsp;
           &#39;Of the same kind&#39; means that if the last grid was added on a group of points or
           a single point, the command can be used if a point is selected; whereas if the
           last grid was added with a polygon or map selected, a polygon or map must again
           be selected.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you added a grid with a group of points or single
           point selected and chose to fill a polygon or map with the grid, then the
           program will search for the smallest polygon or map containing either the point
           itself or the center of the
    pattern extending from the current point as its corner and fill that area.&nbsp; In other words,
    when you use a single point to reuse a previous 5 or 7 point pattern, you can put the point
           right in the middle (as of SerialEM 3.7.4) or you can put it in the corner of
           the grid square, even outside the polygon, as long as the position at the center of
    the previous pattern, starting at that point as its corner, is inside the
    polygon.</P>
    <P>In sum, this command should work just the way you want: add a
    point at the corner of a new area to be filled and run the command, which you
    can do with the menu accelerator Alt-N-M-L.&nbsp; The easiest way to add a single
      point is to place the marker there first, then press 'Add
    Marker'.</P>

        divided into multiple groups.&nbsp; The middle point of the group will be the
        first point, and its distance to every other point in the group will be less
        than the maximum radius set with the <a href="#hid_montaginggrids_setgroupsize">

        option in the Acquire at Items dialog to focus only on the first point in a
        group, and other points will be within a certain distance of the location where
        focus was last done. </P>
    <P>When points are divided into groups, the program will display the result, tell
      you the number of groups and points per group, and ask if you want to keep this

       <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_alignedsupermontage"></A><B>Setup Super Montage command
          (Navigator - Montaging &amp; Grids sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to add a set of rectangles at the positions of overlapping
        montages, laid out on a rectangular grid that is aligned to the camera axes.
        First, you must have montaging set up with the desired number of pieces and
        magnification. Specify a center position in the active image by clicking with
        the left mouse button. Then select this command. You will be asked to enter the
        number of montages in X and in Y then the number of pixels of overlap in X and
        Y. A set of polygons will be created, numbered by their positions in the super
        montage. To try again with different parameters, just use the <B>Delete</B> button
        in the Navigator to delete the whole group of items.</P>
      <P>To get fairly accurate overlaps between montages, use the following procedure.
        First take a montage that encompasses the whole needed area, at a lower
        magnification if necessary. On a Thermo/FEI microscope, it is recommended that you use
        the option to realign with image shift (see <B>Acquiring High-Quality Montages of Large Areas </B>
        in <a href="about_montaging.htm">Montaging</a> and the last paragraph of <i><b>
        Returning to a Position Reliably</b></i> in <a href="about_navigator.htm">Using
        the Navigator</a>
        for details). Turn on 'Align pieces in Overview', and also have
        'Sloppy montage' on as well if this is needed to get the pieces properly
        aligned. Make this montage be a map. Then go to the working magnification for
        the supermontage and set up the montage file. After you answer the queries
        about number of montages and overlaps, you will be asked if you want the
        positions to be laid out at regularly spaced image positions rather than stage
        positions. Do not select this option unless the pieces are indeed properly
        aligned in the area covered by the supermontage (there can be errors in
        alignment elsewhere). Also, only select this option if you are going to use the
        'Realign to Item' routine at some point to get to individual montage positions.
        One approach would be to check 'Acquire' for each of the new montage position
        items and then run the <A HREF="#hid_navigator_acquire">Acquire at Items command</A>
        with the option checked to 'Realign at item'. This will yield montages that can
        be blended and analyzed for overlap.</P>
      <P>The Setup Super Montage command was originally called Aligned Super Montage, and
        there was also a Skewed Super Montage command to lay out montages on a grid
        that is aligned to the specimen axes. Such montages require more overlap to
        avoid gaps between montages, and the stitching programs in IMOD work well with
        the aligned supermontages, so the skew capability has no apparent merit.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_supermontaging_polygonsupermontage"></A><B>Polygon Super Montage

      <P>Use this command to add a set of rectangles at the positions of overlapping
        montages that will fill a polygon. First, you must have montaging set up with
        the desired number of pieces and magnification, and the current Navigator item
        must be a polygon. After you select this command, specify whether the positions
        should be marked for acquisition. The supermontage will include any montage
        that is needed to cover the area within the polygon, with a little allowance
        for errors in positioning. You can then use the 'Skip pieces outside Navigator
        item' option in the <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup dialog box</A>,
        to have each individual montage include only the frames inside the polygon. If
        you use an entry of 0 there to specify the current Navigator item, be sure to

    <P>Use this command to make a polygon from the current set of points marked as
      corners.&nbsp; After the polygon is made, you will be asked whether you want to
      delete all of the corner points.&nbsp;If you answer No, they will be retained
      but no longer be marked as corners.&nbsp; With this command, you can use corner
      points to define one polygon after another, and then set up each polygon for
      automatic acquisition
      into a different montage file.</P>

        not already open. The file will become the current file for saving into.</P>
    <P>When a Navigator file is read, each map file will be located if possible.&nbsp;
      The program will look first at the path specified in the Navigator file.&nbsp;
      If this fails, it will next look in the same directory as the Navigator file.&nbsp;
      Next it will test whether the path starts with &#39;./&#39;. &#39;.\&#39;, &#39;../&#39;, or &#39;..\&#39;, and
      if so, then the program will look for the map file at this path relative to the
      location of the Navigator file. (SerialEM saves an absolute path for the map
      file, but other software might use relative paths.)&nbsp; Finally, it will use
      the information in the Navigator file about where it was last saved to see if
      there was a relative path from the Navigator file to the map file previously,
      and if so, it will look at this relative path from the current location of the
      file.</P>
    <P>If any map file cannot be found, the program will issue a message listing such
      files.&nbsp;&nbsp; If each such map&nbsp; file is moved into the directory of

        in the file being merged will be eliminated, with no change in the properties of 
        the existing items.&nbsp; If an item has a label that matches that of an
        existing item, it will be changed by adding &#39;-1&#39; to it (or &#39;-2&#39; if the label
        with &#39;-1&#39; on it exists, etc.).</P>
    <P>The file being merged in need not be in the same directory as the current
      Navigator file.&nbsp; Map files in the merged file will be located as described

      maximum group size for which all labels should appear, or 0 to draw labels
      regardless of group size.&nbsp; The labels of the first and last points in the
      group will be drawn in groups bigger than the threshold. Also, the labels of up
      to five points around the currently selected point will still be drawn even if
      the selected point is in a group larger than the threshold.&nbsp; Labels will
      also be drawn for points whose distance from the previous point is greater than

      <P><A NAME="hid_options_useitemlabelsinfilenames"></A><B>Use Item Labels in Filenames command (Navigator
        - Options submenu)</B></P>
      <p>Toggle this menu item on to incorporate the item label in the filename created
        when a new file is to be started for an item.&nbsp; If there are no filenames
        defined for previous items when you select <strong>New file at item</strong> or
        <strong>Tilt series</strong>, the filename will be initialized to the item's
        label plus the appropriate file type extension, and that name will appear in the
        file chooser window that comes up for defining the filename. You can add more
        text or replace the label as you desire for this file.&nbsp; If you add text 
        that might be the same as any label (i.e., having numbers), be sure to add it 
        before the label.&nbsp; If there is a
        previous filename that is the basis for a new name and it still contains the
        label of its respective item, then the current item's label will be substituted
        for the previous one.&nbsp; The last occurrence of the label will be replaced if 
        it occurs more than once.&nbsp; To stop having names based on the label, either turn
        off this option or remove the label from the next name that you define.&nbsp; To
        start having names based on the label when there is a preceding filename without
        its label, press <strong>Set Filename</strong> and insert the current item&#39;s 
        label into the name (but again, after any other numbers in the name).</p>
    <p>This option should be particularly useful for generating names that correspond
      between the two axes of dual-axis tilt series.</p>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_autosave"></A><B>Autosave Nav File command (Navigator -

      <P>Toggle this menu item on to have the Navigator items saved to a file
        periodically if they have changed. If there is no currently open file, the
        program will save to a file named AUTOSAVEmmddhhmm.nav, where 'mmddhhmm' are
        two-digit values for month, day, hour, and minute. This file will be removed
        when you save to a file or when the program exits (if you elect not to save at
        that time). However, if the program crashes, you should find the file in the
        directory in which your SerialEM shortcut starts the program.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_writeasxml"></A><B>Write as XML command (Navigator -
        Options submenu)</B></P>
      <P>This command toggles an option to save the Navigator file as an XML file
        instead of in autodoc format.&nbsp; Either one can be read back in by SerialEM.&nbsp;
        The autodoc writing is significantly faster because it is optimized to write each
        line directly to file, whereas to write an the XML file the program builds an
        autodoc data structure, builds an XML structure from that, then writes out the
        XML.&nbsp; This will matter only for very large numbers of points, over 10,000.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_convertmapstobytes"></A><B>Convert Maps to Bytes command
          (Navigator - Options submenu)</B></P>
      <P>This command toggles an option to keep maps in memory as bytes. The option does
        not affect how maps are stored in the image file (typically as integers). Byte
        conversion will reduce memory usage by 2/3, so that the memory required is just
        one byte per pixel. The intensity scaling determined by the Black and White
        levels in the Image Display control panel will be associated with an image when
        a new map is created. This scaling is then applied to convert the image to
        bytes, both when the map is defined and when the map is reloaded from file.
        This scaling could make it impossible to see some light or dark image details.
        There are two ways to prevent such scaling problems. First, adjust the Black
        and White levels to avoid truncating image intensities before designating an
        image as a map. Second, use this menu entry to turn off the conversion option,
        load the map, adjust the Black and White levels as desired, and turn the option
        back on.&nbsp; This option is not saved in the settings file between sessions;
        it can be turned off by default with the general property
        &#39;ConvertMapsToBytesDefault 0&#39;.</P>

      <P>This command toggles an option to have montage maps always loaded unbinned,
        i.e., with overview binning of 1. This is almost always what one wants, but if
        you are short on memory and do not need to see a map at full resolution, you
        can turn off the option and set a higher overview binning in the <A HREF="hidd_montagecontrol.htm">
          Montage Control panel</A> . However, if the map file is open, you must make
        it the current open file before setting the binning in the control panel.</P>

    <P>This command toggles an option to use the current Low Dose parameters for
      Realign to Item instead of the Low Dose parameters set when the map was
      acquired.&nbsp; The option applies only when staying in Low Dose mode for the
      Realign operation, which occurs as long as the current camera, magnification,
      and probe mode (on a Thermo/FEI scope) or alpha (on a JEOL) match the map condition.&nbsp;
      By default, the Realign operation imposes the map conditions when realigning to
      a map.&nbsp; This option is available because there are situations where it is
      advantageous to take the map under different conditions.&nbsp; For example, more
      dose might be desired for the map to allow either better visualization of
      features or more reliable montage piece alignment, while less dose can be used
      for correlating with those maps.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_realign_scaling"></A><B>Try Scaling in Realign

        doing <A HREF="#hid_navigator_aligntoitem">
          Realign to Item </A>.&nbsp; On the first round of the realignment, where an
        image is aligned to the center of a map frame, the program will search for the
        image scaling that makes it align best to the map frame.&nbsp; This scaling is
        then used to adjust the target position (which is not at the center) for the
        shrinkage that occurs.&nbsp; The scaling will not be done if the program is in
        Low Dose mode prior to the Realign operation.</P>
    <p><A NAME="hid_options_search"></A><B>Search + and - Scaling in Realign command
      (Navigator - Options submenu)</B></p>
      <p>This command toggles an option to try scalings both below and above 1 when
        searching for the best scaling in Realign to Item.&nbsp; This might be useful
        when aligning to a synthesized map or one made on a different microscope with
        somewhat lower magnification.</p>

      <p>This command toggles an option to run a script in place of the Record acquisition in
        the Multiple Records routine.&nbsp; The Multiple Records cannot itself be run 
        from script, it must be run from Navigator Acquire at Items.&nbsp; There are 
        probably other restrictions of what the script can do, which will be revealed by 
        malfunctions and crashes.&nbsp; If you want a Record to occur, you must include

        with a drop-down list in which you can select the script by its name or number.&nbsp; 
        It is best to have a (short) name assigned to the script so that if scripts are 
        rearranged, or a different set is loaded, the program will not run the wrong

      <P><A NAME="hid_transform_pts"></A><B>Transform Items command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to transform items from one or more other registrations to the
        current registration. The program will find a transformation whose complexity
        depends on the number of registration points available. Just a shift will be
        found with 1 point, a rotation and shift with 2 points, rotation, scaling, and
        shift with 3 or 4 points, or a full linear transformation including stretching
        and possible image inversion with 5 points. All items except the registration points will then be
        transformed and associated with the current registration. The program will give
        a message about how well the points fit the transformation equation. If the fit
        is very poor, you can undo the transformation with the command described next,
        fix the problem, and redo this command.</P>
      <P>If stretch in the stage coordinate system has been calibrated with the <A HREF="menu_calibration.htm#hid_calibration_stagestretch">
          Stage Stretch command</A> , then transformations based on 2 - 4 points will
        incorporate this stretch, and the report on the transformation in the log will
        include the text '(corrected for stage stretch)'. When transforming after a
        large specimen rotation, such transformations may not be very accurate in the
        absence of such a calibration, but the calibration allows reliable
        transformations with only two or three points.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_undotransformation"></A><B>Undo Transformation command

      <P>Use this command to undo the last transformation done with the <A HREF="#hid_transform_pts">
          Transform Points command</A> . Each item will be returned to its former
        registration, even if items were transformed from more than one registration.
        This is the only way to undo a transformation of imported items.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_changeregistration"></A><B>Change Registration command
          (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to change the registration of an existing item without changing
        the current registration. This is different from changing the registration
        point number, and in fact the command cannot be applied to registration points.
        If you need to change the registration of a registration point, turn off its
        the 'Registration point' button before changing the registration.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_align_to_map"></A><B>Align with Rotation command (Navigator
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command opens the <A HREF="hidd_navrotalign.htm">Align with Rotation dialog box</A>
        , which allows you to align a current image with a map taken prior to rotating
        the specimen. You can also use this alignment to transform items into the new
        registration, although this transformation is of limited accuracy at long
        distances from the point being aligned. In order to open this dialog, the map
        must be in the buffer that images are read into (i.e., just load the map), and
        there must be either an image in buffer A, or a montage overview in buffer B and
        montage center in A, at a different registration from that of the
        map. Thus, after rotating the specimen, increase the current registration in
        the Navigator, then take an image at the same magnification as the map.</P>
       <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_shifttomarker"></A><B>Shift to Marker command (Navigator
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command provides a potentially simple method of shifting items without having to make
        registration points. One way to use it is to add a single point at a
        recognizable feature on an existing map. Then take a new image, click on the
        feature with the left mouse button, and select this command. The <A href="hidd_shift_to_marker.htm">Shift to Marker</A>
        dialog will open with information about the shift and some choices for applying to
        a subset of items and for saving the shift for reuse. If you press OK, all items
         at the registration of
        the image that was clicked on (typically the current registration) will be
        shifted by the same amount. (See the <A href="hidd_shift_to_marker.htm">dialog help</A> for explanations
        of the options there.)  Another way to use this command is to run the <A HREF="#hid_navigator_aligntoitem">
          Realign to Item command </A>on a map or an item located in a map. When the
        procedure is done, take an image, click in the center of it, and select this
        command. Items will be shifted by the error in stage position found in the
        procedure. Finally, the command can be used to shift registration points to fit
        imported items. Suppose you import a map, work out registration points,
        transform the map, and then import another map that is shifted in position.
        Then select one of the registration points, click on the corresponding point on
        the new imported map, and select this command. The registration points will be
        shifted but the map will not, so the points should appear at the right place in

      <p>This menu item is enabled either when the conditions are satisfied for doing the Shift to

      <p>Use this command to shift a set of items at a particular magnification for which a shift
        was saved in the <A href="hidd_shift_to_marker.htm">Shift to Marker</A>
        dialog.  Specifically, if a shift was saved for a magnification, maps taken at
        that magnification that have not been shifted with the Shift to Marker procedure can be shifted, as
        well as any points or polygons marked on them.  First, you will be asked to confirm or specify the
        magnification of the stored shift to use.  If there has been more than one shift saved for that
        magnification, you will next need to specify which one to used, identified by the magnification
        of the image on which the marker point was placed.  Finally, you be asked to confirm the
        specific amount of shift to apply.  See the <A href="hidd_shift_to_marker.htm">Shift to Marker</A>
        dialog help for some scenarios in which this is useful.

      <P>Use this command to undo the shift imposed by the 'Shift to Marker' or

      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_importmap"></A><B>Import Map command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to define an image obtained elsewhere, such as on a light
        microscope, as a map. First, a dialog will open to allow you to select the
        file. You can select TIFF and DigitalMicrograph files (dm3 or dm4 type) as well as MRC
        files, and you can use color images. Then the <A HREF="hidd_navimport.htm">Navigator
          Import dialog box</A> will open to allow you to specify the section number,
        a stage position, a registration number, and a transformation between stage and
        image coordinates. If you import a TIFF file, the stage position and the stage
        to image transformation may be automatically selected if there are tags in the
        file defined in the SerialEMproperties.txt file. The dialog will also allow you
        to make a color overlay of the selected file and the currently selected
        Navigator item, if the latter is an imported map of the same size. Imported
        maps are originally forced to have a registration number separate from those of
        non-imported items, so points marked on imported maps will not appear on other
        images, and vice-versa. However, once you transform the imported map into the
        same registration as the other images, then points marked on the imported map
        will appear on other images and can be used to move the stage to a desired
        location.</P>
    <P>When points are marked on a map, the program stores the ID of the map that they
      were drawn on.&nbsp; This &quot;drawn on&quot; ID is used to help decide what map to use
      for the Realign to Item routine, but an imported map cannot be used in that
      routine.&nbsp; When the imported map is transformed into registration with
      another map, the &quot;drawn on&quot; ID of any non-registration points marked on the
      imported map will be switched to the ID of the map that was registered to, and
      any points added after the transformation will also be given that &quot;drawn on&quot; ID.&nbsp;
      Thus, that map will be preferred for realigning to.&nbsp; In order for this to
      occur, all the registration points must be picked on just the two maps, one
      imported one and one native one being aligned to.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_rotatemap"></A><B>Rotate Map command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to rotate the map in the active buffer into the correct
        orientation for the current magnification and registration, or to rotate an
        imported map by a desired angle and optionally flip it. Specifically, the rotation may include two
        components: the relative rotation between the magnification at which the map
        was acquired and the current magnification; and whatever rotation and mirroring
        around the X axis resulted from any transformations that have been applied to
        the map item. Points will still display correctly on the rotated map, and new
        positions can be marked on it. A map can be rotated more than once, or it can
        be reloaded and rotated to a new orientation.</P>
      <P>If a map is imported and has not yet been transformed into registration with
        native EM maps, then the program will ask you the angle by which to rotate the
        map (counterclockwise is positive), then ask whether to flip the image around 
        the X axis after rotation.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_adjust_backlash"></A><B>Adjust for Backlash command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>With this command, the program will measure the stage backlash at the location
        of the current item and then adjust the item's stage position and record the
        backlash direction used.&nbsp; When stage backlash is substantial, this can
        improve the accuracy of returning to that location.&nbsp; The measurement
        involves dropping magnification if necessary, or going to the View area in Low
        Dose mode, taking an image, then moving away and back by the backlash amount,
        taking a new image, and aligning it.&nbsp; The stage position of the item will
        be adjusted by the alignment shift.&nbsp; The backlash used is the same as the
        backlash for a montage at the starting magnification.&nbsp; The command is
        available only for an item with a directly measured stage position (i.e., a map,
        or point created with <b>Add Stage Pos</b>), and only if the stage is still at
        the original position.</P>
    <P>Note that whenever a map has a backlash recorded for it, the program will
      correct for backlash in the corresponding way when moving to a point marked on
      the map.&nbsp; Montages made with stage movement automatically have a backlash
      recorded, but other maps may require this backlash adjustment, unless they were
      taken at a location where the stage was in a known state with respect to
      backlash.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_backlashsettings"></A><B>Backlash Settings command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to open a dialog box for settings that control whether the
        backlash adjustment routine described just above will be run when a new 
        single-frame map is
        added.&nbsp; The dialog has a text box for specifying the minimum size of map
        for which the program should even consider running the routine.&nbsp; There is 
        no maximum size setting, but the routine will not be run for a map taken in low 
        magnification. There are
        three choices:</P>
    <ol>
      <li>Do not run the adjustment routine automatically or ask whether it should be
        run.</li>
      <li>Ask whether the adjustment routine should be run when making a new map larger
        than the minimum size.</li>
      <li>Run the adjustment routine automatically when making a new map larger than the
        minimum size.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      When you use the <b>Anchor Map</b> function, the program will automatically
      adjust for backlash, if necessary, unless you have chosen option 1.&nbsp; The
      higher magnification item that you are anchoring will also have its position
      adjusted, provided that the stage is still at the same location.</p>

        , which can be used to store and set different states for image acquisition.
        Because the ability to manipulate microscope and imaging state is particularly
        helpful when using the Navigator, this dialog will open automatically along
        with the Navigator if it was open the last time that the Navigator was open. If
        you close the dialog before the Navigator, however, you need to use this

        The microscope state includes magnification, intensity, spot size, and energy
        filter settings. The camera acquisition state includes the binning, exposure
        time, and drift settling of the Record parameter set. Low dose will be turned
        off if it is on. If the file containing the selected map is still open in
        SerialEM, it will be made the current file. If the file is not open, it will be
        reopened so that a new map can be saved into it. This command performs the same
        operation as the <B>Set Map Acquire State</B> button in the <A HREF="hidd_statedlg.htm">

      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_restorestate"></A><B>Restore State command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will restore the microscope and camera acquisition state that was

          or a state set.</P>
       <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_aligntoitem"></A><B>Realign to Item command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command can be used to return accurately to the position of an item by
        correlating with available map images. The item must be located within, or must
        itself be, a map whose extent is large enough to allow the position to be found
        reliably. Specifically, the map must be at least 3 microns in extent (or more,
        if the property file specifies a larger limit). Maps taken in LM mode will not
        be used for these correlations unless they are from a relatively high
        magnification in LM where images can be taken with the objective aperture in.&nbsp; 
        The limit for how low a magnification it will use is controlled by the property 
        RealignItemMaxLMField. There are basically four different situations
        in which this procedure can be used:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>
        The item is not a map, just a point or polygon. It must be located within a big
        enough map, but it can be very near the edge of the map. In this case, the
        program will first move the stage to the center of the map, or to the center of
        one frame of the map if it is a montage, then take an image and align it to
        determine the error in stage position. It will then move the stage to the
        position of the item, take a new image, and align it to work out the error from
        that small stage movement.  If this procedure has been run on a nearby area 
          recently enough, the program is able to use the results of previously aligning 
          to the map center and go directly to the second round of alignment at the item 
          position.<LI>
        The item is a map that is not located in a larger map, so it must itself be
        large enough for reliable localization. The program proceeds as just described,
        except that it ends up aligned to the center of the map.
        <LI>
          The item is a map located within a significantly larger map. In this case, the
          larger map must be the minimum required size, but the item being aligned to can
          be small. The program proceeds as above to find the item position by
          correlating with the larger map. Then it does a third round of alignment by raising the magnification to that of
          the item itself, takes a new picture, and aligns it with the map item using
          image shift. This image shift should be relatively small provided that the
          position was found accurately at the lower magnification, and that the
          calibration of image shift offsets between magnifications is still accurate.</LI>
        <LI>
          The item is a position on a map at a lower magnification than that at which 
          images are to be acquired, and the operation is run in a way that allows it to 
          do a third round of alignment between an image at the higher magnification an appropriately scaled and 
          rotated portion of the map centered on that point.&nbsp; This method is only 
          available when running through the Navigator Acquire at Items procedure or from 
          a script command, not through the menu or the button in the Navigator window.&nbsp; 
          If the position can be marked accurately enough on the map, it has three advantages:
        <UL>
         <LI> There is no need to store a map at the higher magnification as in situation 
           3.
          </LI>
          <LI> The scaled-up reference image can be bigger than the camera frame, which 
            allows shifts larger than half the field of view to be found reliably, provided 
            that the image is not dominated by periodic structures.&nbsp; This is also an 
            advantage over the virtual maps of Schorb et al., Nature Methods 16: 471-477 
            (2019).</LI>
          <LI> If the higher magnification image has a large enough field of view (10 
            microns by default) and the routine is able to skip the first round of 
            alignment, it will skip the second round as well, go directly to the item 
            position, and just do the third round.&nbsp; This is particularly useful for 
            aligning at an intermediate magnification to an LM map, as it avoids going in 
            and out of LM.</LI>

        </UL>
          This method requires a camera parameter set or Low Dose area to be designated for the
          image to be aligned.&nbsp; In Low Dose mode, the area must be at a higher 
          magnification than the map.&nbsp; Outside of Low Dose, the routine must start at 
          a higher magnification than the map.&nbsp; The third round will simply be 
          skipped if these conditions are not met.&nbsp; Parameters for this method are 
          set in the <a href="hidd_navrealign.htm">Navigator Align Setup</a> dialog.</LI>
     </OL>
      <P>When a map is defined, the program stores the brightness, spot size, and
        exposure settings used to take the map images, as well as the state of the
        energy filter if appropriate, and these settings are used in this routine to
        take the images for correlation. The beam size and centering must be robust
        enough to work at the different magnifications. In other words, if the beam
        shifts between the different magnifications, it must be spread enough at one of
        the magnifications so that it still covers the field without being centered.</P>
      <P>The previous state of the microscope is restored after the procedure when it is
        run with this command from the menu or the corresponding button in the Navigator
        window. When it is run from a script, the state may
        or may not be restored depending on what is specified in the script command.&nbsp;
        However, when the routine is called while in Low Dose mode, the state is always
        restored by going back to the previous Low Dose area after taking images in the
        same conditions as the map.</P>
    <P>When in Low Dose mode and realigning to a map taken in Low Dose, the routine 
      will attempt to remain in Low Dose if the current parameters of the area with 
      which the map was taken match the parameters used for taking the map.&nbsp; The 
      match is not considered good enough if there is a change in the camera, the 
      magnification, or the probe mode (on Thermo/FEI) or alpha (on JEOL); or if the 
      defocus offset (for a View or Search map) has changed by more than a limit set 
      by the RealignItemFocusChangeLimit property, which is not set by default.&nbsp; 
      If the match is not good enough, the program will internally leave Low Dose mode 
      by going to the Record area first, which can waste many seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; If 
      the match is good enough, the routine will substitute the map parameters into 
      the Low Dose area and take images with those parameters, unless an option is set 
      in the Tasks-Specials Options submenu to realign with the current area 
      parameters.</P>
      <P>In most cases, the routine will adjust for misalignments between magnifications
      even if you have not selected the 'Adjust image shift between mags' option in
      the Alignment &amp; Focus control panel. Specifically, in situations 1) and 2)
      above, if the microscope state is being restored after the routine runs, then
      the feature being aligned to should appear centered at the restored
      magnification. In situation 3, the feature will be centered at the magnification
      of the map item being aligned to.</P>

      first round if the same map was aligned to recently and the alignment error was
      low enough.&nbsp; If the first round fails, it may be necessary to use this
      command to prevent the skipping on the next attempt.</P>

      <p>This command toggles whether alignment correlations for Realign to Item in Low 
        Dose mode are done after trying to identify and erase periodic peaks in the FFTs 
        used for the correlations.&nbsp; Erasing of peaks seems to work well for gold 
        grids and is essential when working with ones having hexagonally spaced holes, 
        which are much closer together.&nbsp; It does not work reliably for regular 
        carbon grids, which may not have enough remaining non-periodic signal.&nbsp; 
        This option alone determines whether erasing is done in Low Dose mode; the 
        general option in the <a href="hidd_alignfocus.htm">Image Alignment &amp; Focus</a> 
        control panel determines whether erasing is done outside of Low Dose mode.</p>
