      <P>Use this command to read in the items from another Navigator file and merge 
        them in with the items currently present in the table.&nbsp; Duplicate items 
        will be eliminated.&nbsp; If an item has a label that matches that of an 
        existing item, it will be changed by adding &#39;-1&#39; to it (or &#39;-2&#39; if the label 
        with &#39;-1&#39; on it exists, etc.).</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_save_nav_file0"></A><B>Save command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to save Navigator items to a file. The file is a simple 
        tab-delimited text file with the properties of each item. If there is no 
        current Navigator file, you will enter the <A HREF="afx_hidd_filesave.htm">Save As 
          dialog box</A> to specify the file, which will have the default extension 
        .nav. When you select this command again, the entries will be saved to this 
        file.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_saveas_nav_file"></A><B>Save As command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to save Navigator items to a file different from the current 
        file. You will enter the <A HREF="afx_hidd_filesave.htm">Save As dialog box</A> 
        to specify the file. The new file will become the current file for saving into.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_close"></A><B>Close command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to close the Navigator window. If the contents of the window 
        have changed since it was last saved, you will be asked if you want to save 
        them to a file.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_options_setpointlabelthreshold"></A><B>Set Point Label Threshold command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to set a threshold for skipping the drawing of most labels on 
      points when they belong to groups bigger than the threshold.&nbsp; Enter the 
      maximum group size for which all labels should appear, or 0 to draw labels 
      regardless of group size.&nbsp; The labels of the first and last points in the 
      group will be drawn in groups bigger than the threshold. Also, the label of up 
      to five points around the currently selected point will still be drawn even if 
      the selected point is in a group larger than the threshold.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_autosave"></A><B>Autosave Nav File command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Toggle this menu item on to have the Navigator items saved to a file 
        periodically if they have changed. If there is no currently open file, the 
        program will save to a file named AUTOSAVEmmddhhmm.nav, where 'mmddhhmm' are 
        two-digit values for month, day, hour, and minute. This file will be removed 
        when you save to a file or when the program exits (if you elect not to save at 
        that time). However, if the program crashes, you should find the file in the 
        directory in which your SerialEM shortcut starts the program.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_writeasxml"></A><B>Write as XML command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command toggles an option to save the Navigator file as an XML file 
        instead of in autodoc format.&nbsp; Either one can be read back in by SerialEM.&nbsp; 
        The autodoc writing is significantly fast because it is optimized to write each 
        line directly to file, whereas to write an the XML file the program builds an 
        autodoc data structure, builds an XML structure from that, then writes out the 
        XML.&nbsp; This will matter only for very large numbers of points, over 10,000.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_convertmapstobytes"></A><B>Convert Maps to Bytes command 
          (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command toggles an option to keep maps in memory as bytes. The option does 
        not affect how maps are stored in the image file (typically as integers). Byte 
        conversion will reduce memory usage by 2/3, so that the memory required is just 
        one byte per pixel. The intensity scaling determined by the Black and White 
        levels in the Image Display control panel will be associated with an image when 
        a new map is created. This scaling is then applied to convert the image to 
        bytes, both when the map is defined and when the map is reloaded from file. 
        This scaling could make it impossible to see some light or dark image details. 
        There are two ways to prevent such scaling problems. First, adjust the Black 
        and White levels to avoid truncating image intensities before designating an 
        image as a map. Second, use this menu entry to turn off the conversion option, 
        load the map, adjust the Black and White levels as desired, and turn the option 
        back on.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_loadunbinned"></A><B>Load Maps Unbinned command (Navigator 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command toggles an option to have montage maps always loaded unbinned, 
        i.e., with overview binning of 1. This is almost always what one wants, but if 
        you are short on memory and do not need to see a map at full resolution, you 
        can turn off the option and set a higher overview binning in the <A HREF="hidd_montagecontrol.htm">
          Montage Control panel</A> . However, if the map file is open, you must make 
        it the current open file before setting the binning in the control panel.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_corner_montage"></A><B>Setup Corner Montage command (Navigator - 
          Montaging &amp; Grids sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set up a montage to capture the area within the current set 
        of corner points. Be sure to go to the desired magnification before activating 
        this command. You will be opening a new image file for the montage, so if there 
        is already a file open the program will ask whether you want to close it. The 
        program will compute the number of montage frames in X and Y required to 
        capture the area, and decide whether the montage should be acquired with image 
        shift or stage movements. If the area of the Record parameter set is 
        substantially smaller than the camera field, you will be asked whether you want 
        the frame size to be kept smaller than the current Record area. You might want 
        this if the beam is too small to fill the whole camera field. Otherwise, the 
        program will make the frames as large as possible. Unless there are too many 
        frames, you will then go on to the <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup 
          dialog box</A>, in which you will see the number of frames and their size 
        and overlap. If the size of the montage is not reasonable (e.g., bigger than 
        10K by 10K pixels), you can change the magnification to adjust the number of 
        frames and achieve the desired image size. You can also adjust the percentage 
        overlap, which may also change the number of frames needed to fit the desired 
        area. Once you have set up a reasonable montage, go on to the <A HREF="hidd_fileproperties.htm">
          File Properties dialog box</A> then the <A HREF="afx_hidd_filesave.htm">Save As 
          dialog box</A>.</P>
      <P>After the montage is defined, the program will compose a list of pieces that are 
        not needed to capture the intended area. These pieces will be excluded when the 
        montage is acquired.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_polygon_montage"></A><B>Setup Polygon Montage command (Navigator - 
          Montaging &amp; Grids sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>If the current Navigator item is a polygon, use this command to set up a montage 
        to capture the area within the polygon. It works the same as the <A HREF="#hid_corner_montage">
          Setup Corner Montage command </A>.&nbsp; Once the montage is set up to capture 
        an area of a particular shape, it can be used to capture the same area at other 
        locations without drawing a new polygon.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_setupfullmontage"></A><B>Setup Full Montage command 
          (Navigator - Montaging &amp; Grids sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set up a montage to capture the whole grid area. A set of 
        points will be composed that contain the grid area. The command then works the 
        same the <A HREF="#hid_corner_montage">Setup Corner Montage command </A>.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_setgridlimits"></A><B>Set Grid Limits command (Navigator - 
          Montaging &amp; Grids sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to enter lower and upper limits in X and Y for the full grid 
        montage. A dialog box will come up for each limit; enter the desired limit in 
        microns or 0 to use the default limit that is shown.&nbsp; These defaults may be set 
        with the &#39;StageLimits&#39; property in the SerialEMproperties.txt file to prevent the stage from moving beyond a usable range. If you 
        enter a number bigger than one of the defaults, you may get farther out to the 
        corners of the usable area, but the stage will still not be moved beyond that

      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_alignedsupermontage"></A><B>Setup Super Montage command 
          (Navigator - Montaging &amp; Grids sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to add a set of rectangles at the positions of overlapping 
        montages, laid out on a rectangular grid that is aligned to the camera axes. 
        First, you must have montaging set up with the desired number of pieces and 
        magnification. Specify a center position in the active image by clicking with 
        the left mouse button. Then select this command. You will be asked to enter the 
        number of montages in X and in Y then the number of pixels of overlap in X and 
        Y. A set of polygons will be created, numbered by their positions in the super 
        montage. To try again with different parameters, just use the <B>Delete</B> button 
        in the Navigator to delete the whole group of items.</P>
      <P>To get fairly accurate overlaps between montages, use the following procedure. 
        First take a montage that encompasses the whole needed area, at a lower 
        magnification if necessary. On an FEI microscope, it is recommended that you use 
        the option to realign with image shift (see <B>Acquiring High-Quality Montages of Large Areas </B>
        in <a href="about_montaging.htm">Montaging</a> and the last paragraph of <i><b>
        Returning to a Position Reliably</b></i> in <a href="about_navigator.htm">Using 
        the Navigator</a> 
        for details). Turn on 'Align pieces in Overview', and also have 
        'Sloppy montage' on as well if this is needed to get the pieces properly 
        aligned. Make this montage be a map. Then go to the working magnification for 
        the supermontage and set up the montage file. After you answer the queries 
        about number of montages and overlaps, you will be asked if you want the 
        positions to be laid out at regularly spaced image positions rather than stage 
        positions. Do not select this option unless the pieces are indeed properly 
        aligned in the area covered by the supermontage (there can be errors in 
        alignment elsewhere). Also, only select this option if you are going to use the 
        'Realign to Item' routine at some point to get to individual montage positions. 
        One approach would be to check 'Acquire' for each of the new montage position 
        items and then run the <A HREF="#hid_navigator_acquire">Acquire at Points command</A>
        with the option checked to 'Realign at item'. This will yield montages that can 
        be blended and analyzed for overlap.</P>
      <P>The Setup Super Montage command was originally called Aligned Super Montage, and 
        there was also a Skewed Super Montage command to lay out montages on a grid 
        that is aligned to the specimen axes. Such montages require more overlap to 
        avoid gaps between montages, and the stitching programs in IMOD work well with 
        the aligned supermontages, so the skew capability has no apparent merit.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_supermontaging_polygonsupermontage"></A><B>Polygon Super Montage 
          command (Navigator - Montaging &amp; Grids sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to add a set of rectangles at the positions of overlapping 
        montages that will fill a polygon. First, you must have montaging set up with 
        the desired number of pieces and magnification, and the current Navigator item 
        must be a polygon. After you select this command, specify whether the positions 
        should be marked for acquisition. The supermontage will include any montage 
        that is needed to cover the area within the polygon, with a little allowance 
        for errors in positioning. You can then use the 'Skip pieces outside Navigator 
        item' option in the <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup dialog box</A>, 
        to have each individual montage include only the frames inside the polygon. If 
        you use an entry of 0 there to specify the current Navigator item, be sure to 
        reselect the polygon item after defining the supermontage.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_addgridofpoints"></A><B>Add Grid of Points command (Navigator 
          - Montaging &amp; Grids sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to add a set of points on a regular rectangular lattice. Four 
        different kinds of grids can be defined: points in a rectangle; points on a 
        defined rectangular lattice to fill a polygon or map; points along a line, and 
        points at a defined spacing to fill a polygon or map. For the first two kinds, 
        the position of the lattice is specified by a group of 5 points, three at 
        corners of a rectangle and two more adjacent to one of the corners. Here, holes 
        that should be marked with a point are shown with 'X' and the rest of the holes 
        are shown with 'o'.</P>

        &nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X</P>
      <P>To make all of the points be in one group, press the 'Add points' button and 
        mark all 5 points before pressing 'Stop Adding'. As long as one of the points 
        is the current item, you can select this command. The program will then ask for 
        the label of a polygon that you want to fill. If you leave the text box blank, 
        it will create points for all positions in the rectangle indicated by the corners. 
        If you enter a valid label for a polygon that contains the points 
        (specifically, the centroid of the points), then it will add points to fill the 
        polygon, extending the rectangle beyond the corners that you have marked if 
        necessary.&nbsp; If you are filling an elongated region, you can reduce errors 
        from extrapolation by marking the corner with two adjacent points near the 
        middle of the region instead of near one end.</P>
    <P>Once you have added a grid with a 5-point pattern like this, you can add a grid 
      in a new area with the same spacing and orientation by simply adding a single 
      point in the new area.&nbsp; It must be the only point in the group, so press 
      'Add points', add the point, and press 'Stop Adding'.&nbsp; If you are not 
      filling a polygon, the point should be at the same corner of the region to fill 
      as the corner of the 5-point pattern with two adjacent points.&nbsp; If you are 
      filling a polygon, put the point near the middle of the polygon to reduce 
      extrapolation errors.</P>
      <P>To add a line of points, simply add a group of three points to indicate the 
        extent and spacing of the line, such as:</P>
      <P>X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o &nbsp;&nbsp; o 
        &nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp; &nbsp; o &nbsp;&nbsp; o &nbsp;&nbsp; X</P>
      <P>As long as one of these points is the current item, the command will be 
        available and will add a line of points between the endpoints.</P>
      <P>Finally, to add equally spaced points within a polygon or map but not on a 
        defined lattice, simply make the polygon or map be the current item and select 
        this command. Then enter the desired spacing in microns.</P>
      <P>When adding points to fill a polygon or the rectangle of&nbsp;a map, the points 
        will not be placed right up against the border of the polygon. Rather, a square 
        box around each point is required to be fully within the polygon. The size of 
        this box as a fraction of the spacing between points is controlled by the 
        GridInPolygonBoxFraction property, whose default value is 0.75.</P>
      <P>Grid points can be added in two different patterns. One is a zigzag pattern, 
        which was the only pattern in SerialEM version 2.x, and was designed to 
        minimize stage movement when moving between points. The other pattern goes in 
        the same direction in each row and column, and proceeds in an overall direction 
        away from the location of the Focus area in Low Dose mode. This pattern ensures 
        that focusing is done in areas that have already been acquired from.&nbsp; 
        However, this pattern is not used when added points are placed into separate 
        groups.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_montaginggrids_grouppointsingrid"></A><B>Divide Points into Groups command 
          (Navigator - Montaging &amp; Grids sub-menu)</B></P>
      <P>When this option is selected, the set of points added with the
        <a href="#hid_navigator_addgridofpoints">Add Grid of Points</a> command will be 
        divided into multiple groups.&nbsp; The middle point of the group will be the 
        first point, and its distance to every other point in the group will be less 
        than the maximum radius set with the <a href="#hid_montaginggrids_setgroupsize">
        Set Group Radius</a> command.&nbsp; With this arrangement, you can use the 
        option in the Acquire at Points dialog to focus only on the first point in a 
        group, and other points will be within a certain distance of the location where 
        focus was last done. </P>
    <P>When points are divided into groups, the program will display the result, tell 
      you the number of groups and points per group, and ask if you want to keep this 
      grouping.&nbsp; If groups are too large or small, just press No and all the 
      points will be removed.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_montaginggrids_setgroupsize"></A><B>Set Group Radius command

      <P>Use this command to set the maximum radius used for dividing points into groups 
        as described above.&nbsp; Sometimes groups will be smaller than they could be 
        for a particular radius, because the total extent in each direction of the grid 
        gets divided into groups as evenly as possible.</P>

      delete all of the corner points.&nbsp;If you answer No, they will be retained 
      but no longer be marked as corners.&nbsp; With this command, you can use corner 
      points to define one polygon after another, and then set up each polygon for 
      automatic acquisition 
      into a different montage file.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_transform_pts"></A><B>Transform Points command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to transform items from one or more other registrations to the 
        current registration. The program will find a transformation whose complexity 
        depends on the number of registration points available. Just a shift will be 
        found with 1 point, a rotation and shift with 2 points, rotation, scaling, and 
        shift with 3 or 4 points, or a full linear transformation including stretching 
        with 5 points. All items except the registration points will then be 
        transformed and associated with the current registration. The program will give 
        a message about how well the points fit the transformation equation. If the fit 
        is very poor, you can undo the transformation with the command described next, 
        fix the problem, and redo this command.</P>
      <P>If stretch in the stage coordinate system has been calibrated with the <A HREF="menu_calibration.htm#hid_calibration_stagestretch">
          Stage Stretch command</A> , then transformations based on 2 - 4 points will 
        incorporate this stretch, and the report on the transformation in the log will 
        include the text '(corrected for stage stretch)'. When transforming after a 
        large specimen rotation, such transformations may not be very accurate in the 
        absence of such a calibration, but the calibration allows reliable 
        transformations with only two or three points.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_undotransformation"></A><B>Undo Transformation command

          Transform Points command</A> . Each item will be returned to its former 
        registration, even if items were transformed from more than one registration. 
        This is the only way to undo a transformation of imported items.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_changeregistration"></A><B>Change Registration command 
          (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to change the registration of an existing item without changing 
        the current registration. This is different from changing the registration 
        point number, and in fact the command cannot be applied to registration points. 
        If you need to change the registration of a registration point, turn off its 
        the 'Registration point' button before changing the registration.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_shifttomarker"></A><B>Shift to Marker command (Navigator 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command provides a simple method of shifting items without having to make 
        registration points. One way to use it is to add a single point at a 
        recognizable feature on an existing map. Then take a new image, click on the 
        feature with the left mouse button, select this command. You will be told what 
        the shift is and asked to confirm the shift. All items at the registration of 
        the image that was clicked on (typically the current registration) will be 
        shifted by the same amount. Another way to use this command is to run the <A HREF="#hid_navigator_aligntoitem">
          Realign to Item command </A>on a map or an item located in a map. When the 
        procedure is done, take an image, click in the center of it, and select this 
        command. Items will be shifted by error in stage position found in the 
        procedure. Finally, the command can be used to shift registration points to fit 
        imported items. Suppose you import a map, work out registration points, 
        transform the map, and then import another map that is shifted in position. 
        Then select one of the registration points, click on the corresponding point on 
        the new imported map, and select this command. The registration points will be 
        shifted but the map will not, so the points should appear at the right place in 
        this map. This map can then be transformed into registration with EM maps.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_undolastshift"></A><B>Undo Last Shift command (Navigator

      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_align_to_map"></A><B>Align with Rotation command (Navigator 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command opens the <A HREF="hidd_navrotalign.htm">Align with Rotation dialog box</A>
        , which allows you to align a current image with a map taken prior to rotating 
        the specimen. You can also use this alignment to transform items into the new 
        registration, although this transformation is of limited accuracy at long 
        distances from the point being aligned. In order to open this dialog, the map 
        must be in the buffer that images are read into (i.e., just load the map), and 
        there must be an image in buffer A at a different registration from that of the 
        map. Thus, after rotating the specimen, increase the current registration in 
        the Navigator, then take an image at the same magnification as the map.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_new_map"></A><B>New Map from Image command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to define the current image as a map. It performs the same 
        operation as the New Map button in the Navigator dialog; see the
        <a href="hidd_navigator.htm#navab_newmap">help for New Map</a> for a full 
        description.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_importmap"></A><B>Import Map command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to define an image obtained elsewhere, such as on a light 
        microscope, as a map. First, a dialog will open to allow you to select the 
        file. You can select TIFF and DigitalMicrograph files (dm3 type) as well as MRC 
        files, and you can use color images. Then the <A HREF="hidd_navimport.htm">Navigator 
          Import dialog box</A> will open to allow you to specify the section number, 
        a stage position, a registration number, and a transformation between stage and 
        image coordinates. If you import a TIFF file, the stage position and the stage 
        to image transformation may be automatically selected if there are tags in the 
        file defined in the SerialEMproperties.txt file. The dialog will also allow you 
        to make a color overlay of the selected file and the currently selected 
        Navigator item, if the latter is an imported map of the same size. Imported 
        maps are originally forced to have a registration number separate from those of 
        non-imported items, so points marked on imported maps will not appear on other 
        images, and vice-versa. However, once you transform the imported map into the 
        same registration as the other images, then points marked on the imported map 
        will appear on other images and can be used to move the stage to a desired 
        location.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_rotatemap"></A><B>Rotate Map command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to rotate the map in the active buffer into the correct 
        orientation for the current magnification and registration, or to rotate an 
        imported map by a desired angle. Specifically, the rotation may include two 
        components: the relative rotation between the magnification at which the map 
        was acquired and the current magnification; and whatever rotation and mirroring 
        around the X axis resulted from any transformations that have been applied to 
        the map item. Points will still display correctly on the rotated map, and new 
        positions can be marked on it. A map can be rotated more than once, or it can 
        be reloaded and rotated to a new orientation.</P>
      <P>If a map is imported and has not yet been transformed into registration with 
        native EM maps, then the program will ask you the angle by which to rotate the 
        map (counterclockwise is positive).</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_adjust_backlash"></A><B>Adjust for Backlash command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>With this command, the program will measure the stage backlash at the location 
        of the current item and then adjust the item's stage position and record the 
        backlash direction used.&nbsp; When stage backlash is substantial, this can 
        improve the accuracy of returning to that location.&nbsp; The measurement 
        involves dropping magnification if necessary, or going to the View area in Low 
        Dose mode, taking an image, then moving away and back by the backlash amount, 
        taking a new image, and aligning it.&nbsp; The stage position of the item will 
        be adjusted by the alignment shift.&nbsp; The backlash used is the same as the 
        backlash for a montage at the starting magnification.&nbsp; The command is 
        available only for an item with a directly measured stage position (i.e., a map, 
        or point created with <b>Add Stage Pos</b>), and only if the stage is still at 
        the original position.</P>
    <P>Note that whenever a map has a backlash recorded for it, the program will 
      correct for backlash in the corresponding way when moving to a point marked on 
      the map.&nbsp; Montages made with stage movement automatically have a backlash 
      recorded, but other maps may require this backlash adjustment, unless they were 
      taken at a location where the stage was in a known state with respect to 
      backlash.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_backlashsettings"></A><B>Backlash Settings command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to open a dialog box for settings that control whether the 
        backlash adjustment routine described just above will be run when a new map is 
        added.&nbsp; The dialog has a text box for specifying the minimum size of map 
        for which the program should even consider running the routine.&nbsp; There are 
        three choices:</P>
    <ol>
      <li>Do not run the adjustment routine automatically or ask whether it should be 
        run.</li>
      <li>Ask whether the adjustment routine should be run when making a new map larger 
        than the minimum size.</li>
      <li>Run the adjustment routine automatically when making a new map larger than the 
        minimum size.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      When you use the <b>Anchor Map</b> function, the program will automatically 
      adjust for backlash, if necessary, unless you have chosen option 1.&nbsp; The 
      higher magnification item that you are anchoring will also have its position 
      adjusted, provided that the stage is still at the same location.</p>

        , which can be used to store and set different states for image acquisition. 
        Because the ability to manipulate microscope and imaging state is particularly 
        helpful when using the Navigator, this dialog will open automatically along 
        with the Navigator if it was open the last time that the Navigator was open. If 
        you close the dialog before the Navigator, however, you need to use this

        The microscope state includes magnification, intensity, spot size, and energy 
        filter settings. The camera acquisition state includes the binning, exposure 
        time, and drift settling of the Record parameter set. Low dose will be turned 
        off if it is on. If the file containing the selected map is still open in 
        SerialEM, it will be made the current file. If the file is not open, it will be 
        reopened so that a new map can be saved into it. This command performs the same

        present before the last time that 'Set Map Acquire State' was run, or before 
        the imaging state was set from the <A HREF="hidd_statedlg.htm">Imaging State dialog 
          box</A> . If a file was opened when 'set Map Acquire State' was run, that 
        file will be closed again. If the file that was current at that time is still 
        open, it will be made the current file again. Low dose mode will be restored to 
        its state prior to the state changes. This command does the same thing as the <B>Restore 
          Prior State</B> button in the <A HREF="hidd_statedlg.htm">Imaging State dialog 
          box</A> .</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_acquire"></A><B>Acquire at Points command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to acquire images or maps or run a script at a series of points 
        marked for acquisition with the Acquire check box. There must be an image file 
        open before the command can be used to acquire images or maps. If montaging is 
        to be used, this means that the montaging must be set up already. Be sure to 
        have magnification, intensity, and exposure times set before starting the 
        acquisition. This command opens the <A HREF="hidd_navacquire.htm">Navigator Acquire 
          dialog box</A>, which allows various options to be set.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_endacquire"></A><B>End Acquire command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>After starting an 'Acquire at Points', use this command to stop the Navigator 
        from going on to the next item after finishing the current one.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_montage_listfilestoopen"></A><B>List Files/Series/States command 
          (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to get a list in the Log window of everything that has been 
        scheduled to happen in the course of running an 'Acquire at Points' operation. 
        Specifically, the list will show the files that will be opened and their 
        properties, the imaging states to be set when files are opened, and the tilt 
        series that are set up to run.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_deleteitem"></A><B>Delete Item command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to delete the current item from the list, or to delete the 
        group of items summarized on the current line of the table if 'Collapse groups' 
        is on. A group is created whenever a set of items are added in single 
        operation: i.e., when adding a series of points by clicking on an image, when 
        defining a supermontage, or when adding a grid of points. If the current table 
        line summarizes a group, a message box will appear telling you how many items 
        will be deleted and the range of their labels, and asking you to confirm the 
        deletion.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_navigator_aligntoitem"></A><B>Realign to Item command (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command can be used to return accurately to the position of an item by 
        correlating with available map images. The item must be located within, or must 
        itself be, a map whose extent is large enough to allow the position to be found 
        reliably. Specifically, the map must be at least 3 microns in extent (or more, 
        if the property file specifies a larger limit). Maps taken in LM mode will not 
        be used for these correlations unless they are from a relatively high 
        magnification in LM where images can be taken with the objective aperture in. There are basically three different situations 
        in which this procedure can be used:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>
        The item is not a map, just a point or polygon. It must be located within a big 
        enough map, but it can be very near the edge of the map. In this case, the 
        program will first move the stage to the center of the map, or to the center of 
        one frame of the map if it is a montage, then take an image and align it to 
        determine the error in stage position. It will then move the stage to the 
        position of the item, take a new image, and align it to work out the error from 
        that small stage movement.
        <LI>
        The item is a map that is not located in a larger map, so it must itself be 
        large enough for reliable localization. The program proceeds as just described, 
        except that it ends up aligned to the center of the map.
        <LI>
          The item is a map located within a significantly larger map. In this case, the 
          larger map must be the minimum required size, but the item being aligned to can 
          be small. The program proceeds as above to find the item position by 
          correlating with the larger map. Then it raises the magnification to that of 
          the item itself, takes a new picture, and aligns it with the map item using 
          image shift. This image shift should be relatively small provided that the 
          position was found accurately at the lower magnification, and that the 
          calibration of image shift offsets between magnifications is still accurate.</LI></OL>
      <P>When a map is defined, the program stores the brightness, spot size, and 
        exposure settings used to take the map images, as well as the state of the 
        energy filter if appropriate, and these settings are used in this routine to 
        take the images for correlation. The beam size and centering must be robust 
        enough to work at the different magnifications. In other words, if the beam 
        shifts between the different magnifications, it must be spread enough at one of 
        the magnifications so that it still covers the field without being centered.</P>
      <P>The previous state of the microscope is restored after the procedure when it is 
        run with this command from the menu or the corresponding button in the Navigator 
        window. When it is run from a script, the state may 
        or may not be restored depending on what is specified in the script command.&nbsp; 
        However, when the routine is called while in Low Dose mode, the state is always 
        restored by going back to the previous Low Dose area after taking images in the 
        same conditions as the map.</P>
      <P>In most cases, the routine will adjust for misalignments between magnifications 
      even if you have not selected the 'Adjust image shift between mags' option in 
      the Alignment &amp; Focus control panel. Specifically, in situations 1) and 2) 
      above, if the microscope state is being restored after the routine runs, then 
      the feature being aligned to should appear centered at the restored 
      magnification. In situation 3, the feature will be centered at the magnification 
      of the map item being aligned to.</P>
      <P><A NAME="#hid_navigator_force_center_align"></A><B>Force Center Align 
        (Navigator menu)</B> &nbsp;</P>
    <P>This command makes the Realign to Item routine forget previous information 
      about a recent alignment to the center of the map and do the first round of 
      alignment to the map center.&nbsp; By default, Realign to Item will skip that 
      first round if the same map was aligned to recently and the alignment error was 
      low enough.&nbsp; If the first round fails, it may be necessary to use this 
      command to prevent the skipping on the next attempt.</P>
      <P><A NAME="#hid_navigator_realign_scaling"></A><B>Try Scaling in Realign 
        (Navigator menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command toggles an option to try to adjust for specimen shrinkage when 
        doing <A HREF="#hid_navigator_aligntoitem">
          Realign to Item </A>.&nbsp; On the first round of the realignment, where an 
        image is aligned to the center of a map frame, the program will search for the 
        image scaling that makes it align best to the map frame.&nbsp; This scaling is 
        then used to adjust the target position (which is not at the center) for the 
        shrinkage that occurs.&nbsp; The scaling will not be done if the program is in 
        Low Dose mode prior to the Realign operation.</P>
