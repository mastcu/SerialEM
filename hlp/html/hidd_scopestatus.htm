    <P>This window displays critical microscope parameters so that a microscope user
      interface&nbsp; can be covered over by SerialEM.</P>
    <P><B>Current&nbsp; button (Thermo/FEI and JEOL only)</B></P>
    <P>The readout of screen current was eliminated from this panel in SerialEM 4.1.</P>
    <P>This button will launch a small window with the screen current readout in 
      nanoamps (nA).
      If the small focusing screen is in, then this is the amount of current that 
      would be measured if the beam uniformly covered the whole large projection 
      screen. If SerialEM thinks the small focusing screen is in it will display the 
      label as nA-fs. There is an option for smoothing to prevent jitter, in which 
      case it may not respond to very small changes in screen current.&nbsp; Turning 
      this option off may make it easier to judge small changes in current, e.g., when 
      aligning gun tilt.&nbsp; This window will stay on top of all other windows, so 
      it can be seen even if other windows are brought on top of SerialEM. </P>
    <P><B>Dose button</B></P>
    <P>The Dose button will launch a small window showing a cumulative dose in
      electrons per square Angstrom. Dose is added whenever the screen is down, and
      whenever a picture is taken, except that pictures of the Trial and Focus areas
      will be ignored in Low Dose mode. No dose is added when the beam intensity is
      outside a calibrated range. Press the Reset button to zero the cumulative dose.</P>
    <P><strong>Microscope imaging mode</strong></P>
    <P>There is a text indicator of whether the microscope is in TEM, EFTEM, STEM, or 
      diffraction.</P>
    <P><B>Vacuum Quality (VAC, Thermo/FEI and JEOL)</B></P>
    <P>This is an indicator of vacuum quality that may alert you to watch the actual
      vacuum readings in the microscope interface. It should be set up so that green means near perfect,
      yellow means adequate for working, and red means do not open the column values.&nbsp; 
      On a JEOL configured to access a vacuum gauge during updates of the microscope 
      state, the color will show up here if there is no alpha, or on the imaging mode 
      indicator if there is.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;<B>Magnification (X)</B></P>
    <P>This readout shows the current magnification, or camera length in diffraction mode.
      On a Thermo/FEI scope, it changes when the screen is
      raised, so it should match the readout in the Thermo/FEI interface.&nbsp; The X changes
      to LM in low mag mode, INV in an inverted mag range on a Titan, ST or SL in
      STEM, or the camera length units in diffraction mode.</P>
    <P><B>Reset button</B></P>
    <P>Reset the defocus readout to zero. This does not affect the actual focus setting
      of the microscope, but on a Thermo/FEI scope, it will zero its defocus readout.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;<B>Defocus (Def)</B></P>
    <P>This readout shows the same defocus value as appears in a Thermo/FEI interface. On
      a JEOL or Hitachi, it is initially a value relative to the defocus when the program was
      started. It will NOT be the same as the 'measured defocus' reported by the
      autofocus routine. The defocus value shown here is based on the current
      objective lens strength, and it is relative to the lens setting when you last
      selected 'Reset Defocus' in the Thermo/FEI interface, or did a 'Reset Defocus' operation from within
      SerialEM. The 'measured defocus' is based on the amount of image displacement
      that occurs when the beam is tilted, and it should reflect how far the specimen
      is from zero defocus.</P>
    <P><B>Image Shift (IS, PLA, or CLA)</B></P>
    <P>This readout shows the total image shift in microns. When a montage is being
      acquired, this value will briefly reflect the image shift of individual pieces.
      However, in low dose mode, it will show only the image shift used to select the
      field of view and will not show the additional image shift of the acquisition
      areas. On JEOL microscopes where projector shift is being used instead of the
      image shift coils, this field is labeled PLA, but the same kind of shift is
      referred to everywhere else in the program as image shift.&nbsp; On a JEOL, it 
      will be relabeled CLA in STEM mode.</P>
    <P><strong>Illumination mode</strong></P>
    <P>On a Thermo/FEI scope, this indicator will show the probe mode as uP or nP.&nbsp; 
      On a JEOL scope with alpha, the alpha value is shown after the letter &#39;a&#39;.</P>
    <P><B>Spot</B></P>
    <P>The numeric readout shows the spot size. Also, the label 'Spot' has a colored
      background indicating whether the current intensity is calibrated at this spot
      size: blue if intensity is in the directly calibrated range, light cyan if it is 
      in the region outside that range where the 
      calibration is extrapolated, orange if it is completely
      outside the range of a calibration, or magenta if there is no calibration on
      the current side of crossover. This feature can be disabled by adding a line
      'ShowIntensityCalStatus 0' to SerialEMproperties.txt.</P>
    <p>
      <b>Intensity</b></p>
    <p>
      This readout shows the percent C2 or C3 value or the illuminated area in microns
      for a Titan.</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;<b>+</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Opens an optional section with the following entries:</b></p>
    <p>
      <b>Stage X, Y and Z</b></p>
    <p>
      This readout shows the position in microns.</p>
    <P><B>Objective Lens Strength (Obj)</B></P>
    <P>This readout shows the objective lens strength in percent, and will match the
      value shown in the microscope interface on a Thermo/FEI scope.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;<b>Dose rate and S/C buttons</b></P>
    <p>
      This readout appears when
      electron dose is calibrated and shows the estimated dose rate incident on either the
      specimen (in electrons per square Angstrom per
      second) or the camera (in electrons per physical pixel per second). The value is based on a dose calibration plus the change in beam
      intensity from that at which dose was calibrated, which is estimated from the
      beam and spot intensity calibrations.&nbsp; If any of the cameras are direct 
      detectors, the S and C buttons will appear for switching between specimen and 
      camera dose rates.&nbsp; They are enabled only when the current camera is a 
      direct detector and an image has been taken that provides a scaling between 
      specimen and camera doses.&nbsp; In Low Dose mode, the camera dose rate is based 
      on the current magnification, spot size, and intensity, unlike in the camera 
      setup dialog, where it depends on the defined properties of each Low Dose area.</p>
