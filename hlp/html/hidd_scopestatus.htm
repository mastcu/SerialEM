    <P>This window displays critical microscope parameters so that a microscope user 
      interface&nbsp; can be covered over by SerialEM.</P>
    <P><B>Screen current (na) and Float button (FEI and JEOL only)</B></P>
    <P>This readout shows the screen current in nanoamps (na). If the small focusing 
      screen is in, then this is the amount of current that would be measured if the 
      beam uniformly covered the whole large projection screen. If SerialEM thinks 
      the small focusing screen is in it will display the label as na-fs. This 
      readout has some smoothing to prevent jitter, so it may not respond to very 
      small changes in screen current.</P>
    <P>The Float button will launch a small window with the screen current readout. 
      This window will stay on top of all other windows, so it can be seen even if 
      other windows are brought on top of SerialEM. Smoothing is optional in this readout, so it 
      may be more suitable for use when aligning gun tilt.</P>
    <P><B>Dose button</B></P>
    <P>The Dose button will launch a small window showing a cumulative dose in 
      electrons per square Angstrom. Dose is added whenever the screen is down, and 
      whenever a picture is taken, except that pictures of the Trial and Focus areas 
      will be ignored in Low Dose mode. No dose is added when the beam intensity is 
      outside a calibrated range. Press the Reset button to zero the cumulative dose.</P>
    <P><B>Magnification (X)</B></P>
    <P>This readout shows the current magnification, or camera length in diffraction mode.
      On an FEI scope, it changes when the screen is
      raised, so it should match the readout in the FEI interface.&nbsp; The X changes 
      to LM in low mag mode, INV in an inverted mag range on a Titan, ST or SL in 
      STEM, or the camera length units in diffraction mode.</P>
    <P><B>Defocus (Def)</B></P>
    <P>This readout shows the same defocus value as appears in an FEI interface. On 
      a JEOL or Hitachi, it is initially a value relative to the defocus when the program was 
      started. It will NOT be the same as the 'measured defocus' reported by the 
      autofocus routine. The defocus value shown here is based on the current 
      objective lens strength, and it is relative to the lens setting when you last 
      selected 'Reset Defocus' in the FEI interface, or did a 'Reset Defocus' operation from within 
      SerialEM. The 'measured defocus' is based on the amount of image displacement 
      that occurs when the beam is tilted, and it should reflect how far the specimen 
      is from zero defocus.</P>
    <P><B>Reset button (JEOL and Hitachi only)</B></P>
    <P>Reset the defocus readout to zero. This does not affect the actual focus setting 
      of the microscope.</P>
    <P><B>Image Shift (IS or PLA)</B></P>
    <P>This readout shows the total image shift in microns. When a montage is being 
      acquired, this value will briefly reflect the image shift of individual pieces. 
      However, in low dose mode, it will show only the image shift used to select the 
      field of view and will not show the additional image shift of the acquisition 
      areas. On JEOL microscopes where projector shift is being used instead of the 
      image shift coils, this field is labeled PLA, but the same kind of shift is 
      referred to everywhere else in the program as image shift.</P>
    <P><B>Objective Lens Strength (Obj)</B></P>
    <P>This readout shows the objective lens strength in percent, and will match the 
      value shown in the microscope interface on an FEI scope.</P>
    <P><B>Vacuum Quality (VAC, FEI only)</B></P>
    <P>This is an indicator of vacuum quality that may alert you to watch the actual 
      vacuum readings in the FEI interface. It should be set up so that green means near perfect, 
      yellow means adequate for working, and red means do not open the column values.</P>
    <P><B>Spot</B></P>
    <P>The numeric readout shows the spot size. Also, the label 'Spot' has a colored 
      background indicating whether the current intensity is calibrated at this spot 
      size: blue if intensity is in the calibrated range, orange if intensity is 
      outside the range of a calibration, or magenta if there is no calibration on 
      the current side of crossover. This feature can be disabled by adding a line 
      'ShowIntensityCalStatus 0' to SerialEMproperties.txt.</P>

      <b>Stage X, Y and Z</b></p>
    <p>
      This readout shows the position in microns.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Intensity</b></p>
    <p>
      This readout shows the percent C2 or C3 value or the illuminated area in microns 
      for a Titan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Dose rate</b></p>
    <p>
      This readout appears when 
      electron dose is calibrated and shows the estimated dose rate incident on the 
      specimen in electrons per square Angstrom per 
      second. The value is based on a dose calibration plus the change in beam 
      intensity from that at which dose was calibrated, which is estimated from the 
      beam and spot intensity calibrations.</p>
