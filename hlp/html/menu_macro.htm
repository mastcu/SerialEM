          Commands</A> ; for general information about scripts see <A HREF="about_macros.htm">
          About scripts</A> .
      </P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_macro_run1"></A><B>Run commands (Script menu - Run submenu)</B></P>
      <P>Use one of these commands to run a selected script.</P>
    </b>
      <P><A NAME="hid_macro_stop"></A><B>Stop command (Script menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to stop a running script.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_macro_end"></A><B>End command (Script menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to stop a running script at the end of a loop or the end of the 
        script (before repeating). In addition, when a script is run from the Navigator, 
        the End command can be used while the script is stopped to terminate that script 
        and let the Navigator go on to acquire at the next point.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_macro_resume"></A><B>Resume command (Script menu)</B></P>
       <P>Use this command to resume a script that was stopped with the Stop or End 
        command. If you want to start a script from the beginning, run it rather than 
        resuming it. The next command in sequence will be executed if you stopped with 
        End. If you stopped with STOP, the program will show you the line that it 
        stopped on and ask whether you want to redo this command or go on to the next. 
        In some cases a script that stops because of an error condition can be resumed 
        from the point at which it stopped; the program will resume from either the 
        current or next command as appropriate for the type of error.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_macro_toolbar"></A><B>Toolbar command (Script menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command opens a small panel with buttons for all scripts, or as many are 
        specified with the Set Length command. The buttons are wide enough to allow 
        somewhat longer script names than in the <A HREF="hidd_camera_macro.htm">Camera 
          &amp; Script Control Panel</A>. Individual buttons will be enabled when a 
        script is available to run or when it is open in an editing window. You
        can open an editor window for any existing script by holding down the
        Ctrl key while pressing the button.  If you lose 
        the toolbar behind other windows, invoke this menu command again to raise it. 
        The program will remember this window's position and whether it is open 
        between sessions.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_macro_setlength"></A><B>Set Height command (Script menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set the number of buttons in the script toolbar, and their 
        height in pixels.&nbsp; Initially, the toolbar will have 10 buttons.&nbsp; The 
        button height can be increased if the buttons seem too narrow to select 
        reliably.&nbsp; Enter a height of 0 to 
        return to the initial height.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_macro_controls"></A><B>Controls command (Script menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to open the <A HREF="hidd_macrocontrol.htm">Script Controls dialog 
          box</A> in order to set conditions for stopping a script. The script can be 
        stopped when the stage reaches a certain tilt angle, image intensity falls 
        below a certain level, image shift exceeds a certain amount, montage error is 
        too large, or the script has repeated a given number of times.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_macro_edit1"></A><B>Edit command (Script menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use one of these commands to open a <A HREF="hidd_macro.htm">Script Editing 
        Window</A> for editing the given script. Use the left or right
        &#39;Editor &#39; arrows in the editing 
        window to get to higher numbered scripts other than 15 and 20.  You
        can also open an editor for an existing script by holding down the
        Ctrl key and pressing a button for the script in the Script Toolbar or
        in the <A HREF="hidd_camera_macro.htm">Camera &amp; Script Control Panel</A>.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_macro_readmany"></A><B>Load Many command (Script menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to load multiple scripts from a file and place them into their 
        respective script numbers.&nbsp; These scripts must have been saved so that each 
        one starts with a line with &#39;Macro&#39; and the script number, and ends with the line 
        &#39;EndMacro&#39;.&nbsp; This is the way scripts are stored in a settings file as well 
        as by the <a href="#hid_macro_writeall">Save All</a> command, so this
        command can be used to read only the scripts from a 
        settings file. However a single script saved from the editing window cannot be 
        read with this command because it does not have these starting and ending lines.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_macro_writeall"></A><B>Save All command (Script menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to save all currently defined scripts into a single file.&nbsp; 
        They are saved with script numbers, just as in a settings file, so that when this 
        file is read, scripts will go back into the same locations.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_macro_listfunctions"></A><B>List Functions command (Script menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to get a list in the log window of all functions defined in 
      all scripts.&nbsp; The function name will be followed by the number of 
      arguments and 0 or 1 for whether it takes a string argument.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_script_setindentsize"></A><B>Set Indent Size command (Script menu)</B></P>
    <p>Use this command to set the number of spaces that the script editor will use 
      for auto-indenting when Tab or ` (the back-tick character) is typed.&nbsp; This 
      spacing is added at the first line of a block starting with IF, LOOP, ELSE, or 
      Function, and taken away when such a block ends.&nbsp; Enter 0 to prevent 
      auto-indenting.</p>
    <P><A NAME="hid_macro_verbose"></A><B>Verbose command (Script menu)</B></P>
   <P>Use this command to set the initial value of the verbose option when a script is 
        started. With this option on, each script command will be echoed to the log 
        before being executed. The option value can be changed by the Verbose command 
        within a script.</P>
