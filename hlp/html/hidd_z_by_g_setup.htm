        Dialog</span></p>
    <p> This dialog lets you make calibrations needed for the Eucentricity by Focus 
      routine and set a few parameters controlling how the procedure runs.&nbsp; The 
      routine finds the eucentric point by setting a particular absolute focus value 
      (objective lens strength), measuring defocus with beam-tilted images, and 
      adjusting the Z height to bring the measured defocus to the same same value that 
      it had when the microscope was eucentric with that same absolute focus value.&nbsp; 
      (This procedure has been commonly referred to as &#39;Z by G&#39; and Chen Xu has 
      distributed a script by that name.) The point of the calibration procedure here is to measure the defocus and read the 
      absolute focus from the microscope when the specimen is known to be eucentric.&nbsp; 
      This measurement can be done at a preferred defocus and/or with a defocus offset 
      to make it more reliable.&nbsp; Before the calibration, the stage is moved in Z 
      to establish backlash from below if necessary. The Eucentricity by Focus routine 
      itself does all Z moves with the same direction of backlash.</p>
    <p> With an appropriate calibration, the Eucentricity by Focus routine can find 
      eucentricity from a large distance away in Z, and can also do so with very large 
      defocus offsets.&nbsp; However, in either of these cases, an autofocus 
      calibration over a wide range will be needed.&nbsp; See
        <A href="setting_up_serialem.htm#z_by_g_setup">Extended Autofocus and Non-reciprocity Calibration 
      for Using Eucentricity by Focus</A> for details.</p>
    <p> The relation between defocus at eucentricity and absolute focus is 
      magnification dependent, so separate calibrations are stored for different 
      magnifications.&nbsp; At a given magnification, there can also be separate 
      calibrations for different cameras, and for three different states: Low Dose 
      Focus, Low Dose View, and not in Low Dose mode.&nbsp; These calibrations are 
      stored in the settings file, not in the calibrations file, because they may need 
      to be redone frequently (e.g., for each session).</p>
    <p> To make the defocus measurements as reproducible as possible, the 
      illumination conditions are stored (intensity, spot size, and probe mode or 
      alpha) as well as the defocus offset and beam tilt used in the measurement.&nbsp; 
      The line of the dialog below the two 'CALIBRATE with' buttons shows the current camera and which of the three Low 
      Dose states applies.&nbsp; Below that is a summary of the relevant conditions.&nbsp; 
      On the left are the current values from the microscope and program.&nbsp; On the 
      right, if there is a stored calibration matching the magnification, camera, and 
      Low Dose state, are the stored values.&nbsp; You can run the calibration either 
      with the current or the stored scope settings. Here are some relevant points:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Low Dose state will show up as View if the program is in View, otherwise 
        as Focus, because that is the area that will be used for focus measurement.</li>
      <li>If there is no calibration, the Magnification line will say either 'No cals 
        for cam and LD', meaning that there are none matching the camera and Low Dose 
        state, or 'No cal, nearest at X', where X is the nearest magnification with a 
        matching calibration.</li>
      <li>Eucentricity by Focus can still be run if the stored intensity differs from 
        the current one, regardless of Low Dose State.</li>
      <li>In Low Dose mode, the stored spot size and probe mode or alpha can also be 
        different from the current values, but (at least for now) these values must 
        match in order to run the procedure.</li>
      <li>In View mode, the current 'Focus offset' shown is the sum of the View defocus 
        offset and the autofocus offset used in defocus measurement.&nbsp; The calibrated 
        value is the net offset that will be used.</li>
      <li>During both the calibration and the eucentricity routine, the log will show 
        the defocus determined directly from the image displacements at the net defocus 
        offset, not the defocus that would be obtained without that offset.</li>
      <li>The <strong>Update State</strong> button should be used to refresh the current 
        values if you change some settings.&nbsp; The program will automatically update 
        the dialog when the Low Dose state is changed, but not otherwise.&nbsp; It will, 
        however, update the settings first before running a calibration.</li>
    </ul>

      <strong><em>Controls Relevant to the Calibration:</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      CALIBRATE with <strong>Current Settings</strong></p>
    <p>
      Press this button to run a calibration with the current settings, possibly 
      overridden by entries below for focus offset and beam tilt.&nbsp; The calibration will 
      simply measure defocus 3 times and store the average result.&nbsp; If there is 
      an existing calibration shown, it will be replaced by the new one; otherwise, a 
      new calibration is stored.</p>
    <p>
      CALIBRATE with <strong>Stored Settings</strong></p>
    <p> This button is enabled if there is a calibration shown for the current 
      conditions, except that it will be disabled when not in Low Dose mode if the 
      spot size or probe mode or alpha do not match the current conditions.&nbsp; 
      Press it to run with the stored settings, possibly overridden by entries for 
      focus offset and beam tilt.&nbsp; The calibrations will replace the existing 
      one.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Calibrate with focus offset of</strong></p>
    <p>
      Turn on the check box and enter an alternative value for the focus offset to use 
      in a calibration.&nbsp; For measuring with View, this offset overrides both the 
      View defocus offset and the autofocus focus offset.&nbsp; <em>This setting is 
      very important when using View: it is recommended that you not use a defocus 
      offset bigger than -50 if possible, to avoid the need for an autofocus 
      calibration extending to very high underfocus values.</em></p>
    <p>
      <strong>Calibrate with beam tilt of </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Turn on this check box and enter an alternative value for the beam tilt to apply 
      when measuring defocus.&nbsp; You may well want a higher value for focusing with 
      View, to yield larger displacements that can be measured more accurately.</p>
    <p> <strong><em>Controls Relevant when Running Eucentricity by Focus:</em></strong></p>
    <p> <strong>Use View area in Low Dose mode</strong></p>
    <p> The checkbox controls whether the Eucentricity by Focus routine will measure 
      defocus with View or Focus in Low Dose mode.&nbsp; There must be a calibration 
      for whichever area will be used.</p>
    <p> <strong>Use current area - 1/4 - 3/8 - 1/2 field</strong></p>
    <p> These radio buttons are enabled when using the View area and allow you to 
      measure defocus with a selected subarea, to minimize the contribution from 
      regions several microns from the center that may be at a different height.&nbsp; 
      The closest feasible region for the particular camera </p>
    <p> <strong>Maximum total change in Z</strong></p>
    <p> The Eucentricity by Focus routine will stop with an error and restore the 
      original Z position if the change in Z implied by the latest defocus measurement 
      would result in the total change in Z exceeding this amount.&nbsp; This entry is 
      intended to provide some protection against wild defocus values being measured 
      on a bad specimen area.&nbsp; However,because of the nonlinear relationship 
      between Z and defocus, the entry may need to be considerably larger than the 
      actual Z change for it not to fail on large Z changes.&nbsp; This depends on how 
      well the nonlinearities are accounted for in the procedure (see below).&nbsp; 
      For example, an entry of 140 may be needed to allow for 100 micron changes.</p>
    <p> <strong>Threshold Z change for iterating</strong></p>
    <p> The routine will iterate up to 5 times as long as the defocus difference from 
      the target value is bigger than the threshold value set here.&nbsp; The default 
      value is 0.5 microns; a smaller value might be appropriate if stage moves are 
      quite accurate, whereas a larger value might be needed if they are relatively 
      inaccurate.</p>
