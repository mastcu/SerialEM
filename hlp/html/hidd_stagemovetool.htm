    <P>This floating tool, opened from the Window menu, allows you to move the stage 
      in any direction and by a chosen multiple of the current camera field of view. 
      Pressing the left mouse button anywhere outside the central gray circle and 
      within the outer red circle will start a stage movement.&nbsp; The direction of 
      movement will correspond to the direction from the center of the circles to the 
      mouse position.&nbsp; The amount of movement depends on the distance of the 
      mouse from the center:</P>
    <P>Within the thick blue circle, the distance is proportional to the distance from 
      the center, becoming equal to the camera field of view at the thick blue circle.
    </P>
    <P>Outside the thick blue circle, the distance changes faster, becoming equal to 
      twice the camera field of view at red circle.
    </P>
    <P>If the mouse button is held down, the stage move will be repeated as soon as it 
      ends.&nbsp; The same movement will occur even if the mouse is moved while the 
      button is held down.</P>
    <P>For a non-square camera, the amount moved is determined by the minimum of the X 
      and Y size so that there will be some overlap between images after moving by 
      less than a full field, regardless of direction.</P>
    <P><b>Take Image after Move</b></P>
    <P>If this checkbox is selected, the program will take an image of the indicated 
      type when the move is finished, unless there is already a continuous acquisition 
      underway.&nbsp; The image will be a View if in Low Dose mode, or a Trial if out 
      of Low Dose.</P>
