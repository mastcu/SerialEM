    Parameters Dialog</span></P>



    <p>
      This dialog allows you to set parameters to control alignment of frames taken 
      from a K2 or K3 camera in Dose Fractionation mode, or from a Falcon or Direct Electron camera.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>
      <i>With a K2/K3 camera</i>, the alignment can be done in 
      three different ways: with the native alignment procedures in DigitalMicrograph, 
      with the &#39;framealign&#39; module in SerialEM&#39;s plugin to DM, or 
      independently of SerialEM with the Alignframes 
      program in IMOD, which incorporates the same &#39;framealign&#39; module and thus uses 
      the same parameters.&nbsp; In the latter case, all that the plugin to DM does is write 
      a command file for running the alignment in IMOD after all of the frames have 
      been saved.&nbsp; The Framewatcher program in IMOD can be used to process these 
      command files as soon as they appear.</p>
    <p>
      <i>With a Falcon camera</i>, the alignment can generally be done in two or three 
      similar ways: with the FEI software that aligns frames from Falcon 3 camera, 
      with the &#39;framealign&#39; module incorporated into SerialEM, or with the Alignframes 
      program in IMOD.&nbsp; Again, in the latter case all that SerialEM does is write 
      a command file.&nbsp; The availability of the different forms of alignment and 
      how data are processed depends on the details of the system.&nbsp; Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For Falcon 2 running through the standard scripting interface, FEI software 
        writes the frames as raw files on the microscope computer.&nbsp; They are read 
        by SerialEM&#39;s microscope plugin or server and sent to SerialEM to be aligned 
        and/or stored in an MRC file.&nbsp; Both methods of alignment with &#39;framealign&#39; 
        will always be available.</li>
      <li>For Falcon 2 running through the advanced scripting interface, FEI software 
        writes the frames as an MRC stack in a standard storage location on the 
        microscope computer.&nbsp; Alignment by SerialEM will always be available 
        because SerialEM&#39;s plugin or server can read them and send them to SerialEM.&nbsp; 
        Writing a command file for alignment with IMOD is available only if SerialEM has 
        direct access to the file system on the microscope computer.</li>
      <li>For Falcon 3, FEI software writes the frames as an MRC stack on the storage 
        server.&nbsp; This dialog, and alignment with &#39;framealign&#39; by either method, is 
        available only if SerialEM has direct access to the file system on the storage 
        server.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <i>With a DE camera</i> running a server version higher than about 1200, frame 
      alignment can be done within SerialEM or by writing a command file to run 
      Alignframes in IMOD, provided that SerialEM is running on the DE server.&nbsp; 
      Alignment is done in SerialEM by reading in the frames from disk. In addition, 
      there may be a frame alignment available through the DE server.</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style2">
      Aligning in DigitalMicrograph or FEI or DE Software</p>
    <p>
      For a K2/K3, the alignment in DM has only one parameter, the filter that is used in the 
      alignment procedure.&nbsp; The combo box should show the same set of filters 
      that are available in DM; if not, the SerialEMproperties file needs to be 
      modified to list the correct filters.</p>
    <p>
      For Falcon 3, alignment with the FEI software has no parameters but does require 
      a certain minimum exposure time per frame.</p>
    <p>
      For a DE camera with the frame alignment option, again there are no parameters.</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style2">
      Aligning in the SerialEMCCD Plugin or SerialEM</p>
    <p>
      Alignment with the &#39;framealign&#39; module has many more parameters.&nbsp; Virtually 
      all of the ones shown in this dialog correspond exactly to an Alignframes 
      option, so the man page for that program can be consulted for more details about 
      any particular option, as well as for general instructions and advice.&nbsp; The 
      reason that there are so many parameters is that different settings are needed 
      to obtain optimal results in fundamentally different situations.&nbsp; Still, it 
      should be possible to set up a small selection of parameter sets that will work 
      for your own data.&nbsp; SerialEM can store multiple parameter sets, and this 
      dialog allows you to chose among them.&nbsp; The selection is stored as part of 
      the individual camera parameter set.&nbsp; If you have no previously defined 
      parameter sets, the program will add two sets suitable for use with counting 
      mode and super-resolution frames.&nbsp; These default parameters are a good 
      starting point and may well be adequate for you.</p>
    <p>
      The dialog gives a choice among several alignment strategies.&nbsp; Which one is 
      appropriate depends on the kind of data being taken and its noise level.&nbsp; 
      One basic strategy is to find shifts for individual frames by fitting to 
      measurements of shifts between many pairs of frames (the approach of the 
      'motioncorr' program from UCSF). This method uses comparable amounts of 
      information for all of the frames.&nbsp; The implementation here has two 
      important features: 1) the fits can be done to pairwise shifts measured for 
      subsets of frames, thus giving the benefits of the approach without requiring as 
      many measurements; and 2) the fitting is done with 'robust regression', which 
      weights measurements less the more they deviate from the fitted solution used, 
      so that a few bad correlations can be effectively ignored.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      different options in the dialog allow the fits to be done to a fixed number of 
      frames, half the frames, or all the frames.&nbsp; The other basic strategy 
      involves correlating each frame to a sum of previously aligned frames; this is 
      not as reliable in general because it uses less information for finding the 
      shift of the first few frames, and is more susceptible to fixed pattern noise.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>
      Both methods can be followed by a refinement step in which each frame is 
      correlated with the aligned sum of all other frames (this is similar to what is 
      done in the unblur program from Grigorieff's group).&nbsp; This step probably 
      has no benefit if the errors from the initial fit are low.&nbsp; The Alignframes 
      man page describes how to evaluate whether one particular parameter selection is 
      better than another.</p>
    <p>
      The general advice about which approach to use is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fitting to pairwise shifts of 7-9 frames at a time is good for typical tilt 
        series data with 5-15 frames, because there are generally enough features in the 
        field to provide a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio.</li>
      <li>Fitting to pairwise shifts of half the frames at a time is generally good for 
        single-particle images with long exposures, as it both saves some time and 
        avoids correlating images that may differ due to specimen damage.</li>
      <li>Fitting to pairwise shifts of all the frames may be needed for noisier data or 
        to handle situations where there may be very little contrast in the field.</li>
      <li>For even noisier data, aligning sums of successive frames, called grouping, 
        may be needed in the initial alignment; but grouping may not work well for early 
        frames if there are substantial shifts between frames, so refinement is a good 
        idea.</li>
      <li>Alignment to a cumulative reference should be used only if there is a 
        relatively high signal-to-noise ratio, such as for a stained specimen. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some other main points about the parameters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low-pass filtering of low-dose images is essential.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>The high degree of binning provides for both a speedup in alignment and the 
        first level of filtering.</li>
      <li>The second level of filtering is provided by a gaussian filter that starts at 
        a specified cutoff filter and fall off with a sigma proportional to the cutoff.&nbsp; 
        This is not like the traditional &quot;B-factor&quot; Gaussian filter that starts falling 
        off from 0.</li>
      <li>Filter cutoffs are in reciprocal pixels in the unbinned image (0.5 
        cycles/pixel is the Nyquist, the highest frequency that can be represented, in 
        the unbinned image).&nbsp; This means that their effect stays the same if you 
        change binning.</li>
      <li>A cutoff value of 0.06 is good for typical data; some super-resolution frames 
        may require 0.05; most data can probably tolerate somewhat higher values, 
        possibly up to 0.1.</li>
      <li>The binning for alignment is independent of the binning for the returned 
        image, which is what is specified in the Camera Setup dialog.</li>
      <li>The term &quot;binning&quot; is a misnomer in both cases: the image is reduced for 
        alignment with real-space anti-aliased reduction; the final image is reduced by 
        Fourier cropping.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The plugin will do cross-correlations for each frame as soon as it available, 
      and will do the final shift of a frame and its addition into the aligned sum as 
      soon as allowed by the parameters. If the time taken for alignment is a 
      consideration, then you should be aware of which options make it unable to do 
      any final shifts until all frames are received: doing pairwise fits among ALL 
      the frames; refining the initial alignment; doing spline smoothing of the 
      estimated shifts; and testing more than one filter cutoff without selecting to 
      use 'hybrid shifts', which are available before the end.&nbsp; However, you will 
      probably find that using these options costs less than 0.1 second per frame.</p>
    <p>
      Frames can be acquired dark-subtracted or unprocessed instead of gain-normalized if they are 
      also going to be saved as compressed TIFF files.&nbsp; The data will be 
      normalized by the framealign module before being aligned, and the aligned sum 
      will thus be gain-normalized.</p>
    <p>
      When an alignment is done, results may be printed to the log.&nbsp; In their 
      full form, they look like this:</p>
    <pre>Frame alignment results:          distance raw = 2.7 smoothed = 1.3
Weighted resid mean = 0.16  max max = 0.32  Mean unweighted max = 0.57
FRC crossings 0.5: 0.0335  0.25: 0.0468  0.125: 0.0898  is 0.1025 at 0.25/pix    </pre>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Distance raw:</i> the sum of all the measured shifts between successive 
        frames, in unbinned pixels; measurement errors will make this number exceed the 
        actual distance moved by the specimen.</li>
      <li><i>Smoothed:</i> the sum of measured shifts between successive frames after 
        whatever smoothing is applied to them.&nbsp; This is the best indicator of the 
        total amount of drift.&nbsp; If the raw distance is much bigger, it can be a 
        sign of inaccuracies in the shift measurements.</li>
      <li><i>Weighted resid mean:</i> the single best measure of the quality of the 
        alignment.&nbsp; A residual is the difference between a measured shift and the 
        shift implied by a linear fit.&nbsp; A weighted mean residual is obtained for 
        each individual robust linear fit and it appropriately ignores shifts with large 
        errors just as they are ignored in obtaining the solution.&nbsp; The value here 
        is this mean residual averaged over all of the fits.&nbsp; Values in the range 
        of 0.1-0.4 indicate good fits overall.</li>
      <li><i>Max max</i>: the maximum value of the weighted residual found in any of the 
        fits, which indicates the error in the worst shift that is actually used.</li>
      <li><i>Mean unweighted max:</i> This maximum residual is an unweighted one, the 
        actual error between a measured shift and the one given by the fits.&nbsp; The 
        value is the average of the maxima obtained in each of the fits.&nbsp; A high 
        value is a sign that bad shifts are being measured between some pairs of frames; 
        but if the &quot;Max max&quot; for weighted residuals is still fairly low, it means that 
        the robust fitting successfully suppressed all of those bad shifts.</li>
      <li><i>FRC crossings:</i> Odd and even frames can be summed separately and the 
        Fourier ring correlation computed.&nbsp; The first three pairs of numbers are 
        the frequencies (in unbinned reciprocal pixels) at which the FRC falls below 
        particular levels.&nbsp; In the example, it falls below 0.5 at 0.034/pixel, 
        below 0.25 at at 0.047/pixel, and below 0.125 at 0.090/pixel.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;<i>FRC value at 0.25/pix:</i> The final value is the FRC at half-Nyquist 
        in the unbinned image.</li>
    </ul>
    If there are not enough frames for robust fitting, the output will be somewhat 
    simpler and reflect only actual residual errors, since no weighting is being 
    done.&nbsp; The number of lines of output can be set by the
    <a href="menu_camera.htm#hid_camera_setframealignlines">Set Frame Align Lines</a> 
    command in the Camera menu.&nbsp; The default is to omit the FRC values since 
    these are the most difficult to interpret and depend on the sample and dose.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Aligning in IMOD</b></p>
    <p>
      The same parameter settings are presented when writing command files for 
      aligning with Alignframes as for aligning in the plugin.&nbsp; The principal 
      difference is that one needs to select a folder where the command files will be 
      written, and that one can align and stack an entire tilt series after 
      completion.&nbsp; The files will actually have extension '.pcm' instead of 
      '.com'.</p>
    <p>
      Time should not be an issue when doing alignments with this option, since the 
      alignments are generally fast enough to be done well before the next set of 
      frames needs aligning.&nbsp; Thus you can use refinement, smoothing, or multiple 
      filters routinely without worrying about whether they are actually helping.</p>
    <p>
      K2/K3 frames can be taken unnormalized in order to save efficiently in compressed 
      TIFF files.&nbsp; The command file will contain options to apply 
      gain-normalization and defect correction.</p>
    <p class="style1">
      Global Settings</p>
    <p>
      The upper part of the dialog, down to the box for <b>Parameter set name</b>, 
      allows one to set a few &#39;global&#39; settings that apply to all alignments.&nbsp; 
      The list box on the right shows the available parameter sets, which can be 
      selected by clicking on one.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Use the GPU</b></p>
    <p>
      Select whether to use the GPU on an NVIDIA card for the frame alignment.&nbsp; 
      This setting is kept track of separately for aligning immediately versus 
      aligning in IMOD, because the latter could be done by any computer with access 
      to the frame data.&nbsp; In fact, if there are two K2/K3&#39;s, or a K2/K3 and a Falcon, 
      it is kept track of separately for each camera.&nbsp; This option should be
      available if NVIDIA drivers are installed, and the files FrameGPU.dll, 
      cudart64_41_28.dll and cufft64_41_28.dll are in the correct location: 
      specifically, for a K2/K3 camera, in
      C:\ProgramData\Gatan\Plugins along with the SEMCCD-GM2-64.dll plugin; and for a 
      Falcon or DE camera, in the same folder as the SerialEM executable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Align only whole tilt series</b></p>
    <p>
      This option is relevant when aligning in IMOD and only for a Record parameter 
      set; when it is checked, a command file is not produced for individual Record 
      images, only at the end of a tilt series.&nbsp; That command file will align all 
      of the frame files for the tilt series and construct a new stack with 
      appropriate header entries, using a copy of the .mdoc file for the original tilt 
      series stack.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Set Folder for Align Com Files</b></p>
    <p>
      Press this button to select the folder where the command files will be written 
      when aligning in IMOD.&nbsp; This folder must be on the same drive as the frame 
      files, because the command file needs to be written with relative paths that 
      would be meaningful if processing on another machine.&nbsp; With a K2/K3 camera, if SerialEM is 
      running on a microscope computer, then the folder name must be typed into the 
      dialog box that comes up.&nbsp; If it is running on the K2/K3 computer, then a 
      folder chooser will come up just as it does for selecting the frame folder.&nbsp; 
      A folder chooser comes up for a DE camera, and for a Falcon 2 camera when 
      SerialEM is running on the microscope computer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Use same folder as frames</b></p>
    <p>
      Select this option to have command files written into the same folder as the 
      frames, thus overriding any entry that was made with the <b>Set Folder</b> 
      button.</p>
    <p>
      <b>New Parameter Set</b></p>
    <p>
      Press this button to create a new set of parameters that start out as a copy of 
      the currently selected one.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Delete</b></p>
    <p>
      Press this button to delete the currently selected set of parameters.&nbsp; This 
      is possible only when there is more than one set, because the program always 
      needs at least one set. If any other camera parameter sets have selected this 
      set, their selection will be changed to the adjacent set; and if any of those 
      have frame alignment enabled, the program will warn you about this change.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Parameter set name</b></p>
    <p>
      Here you can edit the name of the set that appears in the list box.</p>
    <p class="style1">
      Restrictions on When to Use a Parameter Set</p>
    <p>
      This group of check-boxes lets you control whether a parameter set is to be used 
      only in under certain conditions.&nbsp; Namely, you can specify that a set 
      should be used only when <b>Aligning in plugin</b> (or in SerialEM) or only when <b>Aligning with 
      IMOD</b>, and independently whether it should be only for <b>non 
      super-resolution frames</b> or only for <b>super-resolution frames</b>.&nbsp; 
      The restrictions based on size may be superfluous if one specifies binning to a 
      target size rather than by a fixed amount for alignment.&nbsp; The restrictions are taken into account at several places in the program, where 
      the currently selected parameters are tested for whether they meet the 
      conditions.&nbsp; If they do not, the program analyzes whether the conditions 
      are met by no, one, or several other parameter sets, and acts in various ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you close this dialog, you will be given a choice of whether to use the 
        selected set anyway (if there are no suitable ones), use the one suitable set 
        (if there is one), or use the first suitable set (if there is more than one), or 
        whether to stay in the dialog to change some settings.</li>
      <li>When you switch between aligning in the plugin and with IMOD, it will 
        automatically switch to another set if it is the only suitable one, otherwise 
        leave the selection as it is.</li>
      <li>In the Camera Setup dialog, when you switch between Counting and 
        Super-resolution modes, it will automatically switch to another set if it is the 
        only suitable one.&nbsp; Otherwise, you will be given a choice of whether to 
        switch the mode back, open the dialog, use the selected set anyway (if there are 
        no suitable ones), or use the first suitable set (if there is more than one).</li>
      <li>When an image is to be acquired, it will automatically use another set if it 
        is the only suitable one or the first suitable set if there is more than one; 
        otherwise it will use the current set anyway.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The use of restrictions will work most conveniently if you have only one 
      parameter set for each kind of situation, each one marked with different 
      restrictions.&nbsp; For a K2/K3 or DE, if you have just the &quot;4K default set&quot; and &quot;8K default set&quot;, 
      simply restrict each one to the respective size of frames, and the parameter set 
      will switch automatically when you switch between super-resolution and counting 
      mode.&nbsp; However, if all the parameters except binning are the same, it may 
      be simpler just to bin to a target size.</p>
    <p class="style1">
      Basic Alignment Parameters</p>
    <p>
      The parameters in the upper section are the ones most likely to need setting.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Truncate values above n electrons (K2 only)</b></p>
    <p>
      Select this option and set the number of electron counts to have values above 
      that number replaced by the local mean.&nbsp; This is the number of electrons 
      per acquired pixel, which cannot be higher than 15 for super-resolution frames. 
      If your gain-normalized images have many extreme values, removing them from the 
      frames may make the alignment more reliable, as well as making it easier to see 
      the data in 3dmod.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Alignment strategy</b></p>
    <p>
      Here one can choose among the options described above.&nbsp; Here are a few 
      points to note.&nbsp; If the number of frames in the first option is set higher 
      than the actual number of frames, it will have the same effect as fitting to ALL 
      pairwise shifts.&nbsp; The second option, to fit to pairwise shifts of HALF the 
      frames, will actually fit to a minimum of 7 frames. If alignment to a cumulative 
      reference is chosen, grouping of frames and testing of multiple filter cutoffs 
      are not available.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Alignment binning</b></p>
    <p>
      Binning, actually antialiased image reduction, is one of the two most important 
      parameters because it affects processing time as well as the accuracy of the 
      fits.&nbsp; Binning should be set to bring images to a size of 1000 to 1250 
      pixels; thus 3 or 4 for ~4K images and 6 or 8 for ~8K images.&nbsp; You can 
      choose to set either a specific binning or a target size to which images should 
      be binned.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Filter cutoff</b></p>
    <p>
      The filter cutoff is the most important parameter; it is expressed in cycles per 
      pixel in the unbinned frame so that a value has about the same effect with 
      different binnings.&nbsp; Optimal values are generally in the range of 0.05 to 
      0.07.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Maximum shift between frames</b></p>
    <p>
      This entry sets the maximum shift that will be detectable from one frame to the 
      next, in unbinned pixels.&nbsp; Larger shifts are allowed between more separated 
      frames, but the shifts have to be in a range predicted by the relative shifts of 
      the intervening frames.&nbsp; This parameter should probably not be in the basic 
      section.&nbsp; The default in Alignframes is 20.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Group frames by n</b></p>
    <p>
      Select the checkbox to have successive frames summed together (without 
      alignment) for the initial correlations.&nbsp; The spin box sets the number of 
      frames to sum.&nbsp; When frames are very noisy, grouping by 2 or 3 can bring 
      the correlation peak out of the noise.&nbsp; All possible sums of successive 
      frames are formed, but correlations are done only between sums that do not 
      overlap. This increases the number of frames required to use this approach, 
      which is shown after the spin button.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Refine alignment with up to n iterations</b></p>
    <p>
      Select the checkbox to add a refinement step after all the initial correlation 
      have been done.&nbsp; Even multiple iterations of refinement are relatively 
      quick because all of the FFTs that need correlating are already available.&nbsp; 
      The spinner sets the maximum number of iterations that will be run, but 
      refinements often stop after fewer iterations because the changes have fallen 
      below a threshold.&nbsp; Five iterations is generally sufficient unless refining 
      with group sums.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Smooth shifts if at least n frames</b></p>
    <p>
      Select this checkbox to apply spline smoothing to the shifts if there are at 
      least as many frames as selected in the spinner.&nbsp; This smoothing may have a 
      very small benefit but should only be used if there are enough frames to give a 
      good assessment of the smoothing that is needed.&nbsp; The default in 
      Alignframes is to smooth shifts when there are at least 15 frames, but this is 
      left as a choice here because smoothing is one of the options that prevents any 
      frames from being summed until all have been aligned.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Align subset of frames</b></p>
    <p>
      Select this checkbox to align only a subset of the frames being saved, then fill 
      in the starting and ending frames to align, numbered from 1.&nbsp; The option is 
      irrelevant when no frames are saved, because in that case a drift settling time 
      can be set for K2 to discard initial frames after the exposure starts.&nbsp; When 
      frames are being aligned in the plugin to DM or in SerialEM, the image shown in SerialEM will be a 
      sum of only the aligned frames.&nbsp; When frames are aligned with IMOD, the 
      command file will contain the <i>-frames</i> option to Alignframes with the 
      given starting and ending frames.</p>
    <p class="style1">
      More Advanced or Less Commonly Needed Parameters</p>
    <p>
      <b>Refine in groups</b></p>
    <p>
      When frames are exceedingly noisy, correlations between a single frame and an 
      aligned sum may not be reliable enough, so this option is available to do the 
      refinement with groups of aligned frames instead of single frames.&nbsp; The 
      iterations for refinement should be set to 10 if this option is used.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Filter cutoff for refining</b></p>
    <p>
      In this box, you can enter an alternative cutoff radius in cycles/pixel to use 
      for the refinement step; otherwise the same cutoff will be used as for the 
      initial alignment.&nbsp; Large increases will impair the alignment, but an 
      increase of ~25% might be beneficial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Stop refining when changes are below n unbinned pixels</b></p>
    <p>
      This entry sets the threshold change in shifts for continuing to iterate the 
      refinement of the initial alignment.&nbsp; The default in Alignframes is 0.1 
      unbinned pixel.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Other filter cutoffs</b></p>
    <p>
      These two text boxes allow additional filter cutoffs to be tested at the same 
      time as the main cutoff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Use hybrid shifts</b></p>
    <p>
      When multiple filters are being tested, the default is to accumulate all the 
      alignment results, then pick one filter as best and apply the shifts from it to 
      form the aligned sum.&nbsp; If this option is checked, then a best filter will 
      be picked after each individual fit to a set of pairwise shifts, and the shift 
      implied by the fit with that filter will be used for the one image whose shift 
      is being set after that fit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ratio of falloff sigma to filter cutoffs</b></p>
    <p>
      The ratio in this text box is used to scale the sigma of the Gaussian falloff of 
      the high-frequency filter proportionally to the cutoff.&nbsp; Such scaling is 
      done when using the '-vary' option in Alignframes, and the default ratio there 
      (1/7) is based on the ratio of default values for cutoff and falloff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Always process gain-normalized frames with full precision (K2 only)</b></p>
    <p>
      This option should not be used; just make sure that you have <i>not</i> selected 
      &#39;Divide 16-bit by 2&#39; and the precision will be as good as with a K3.&nbsp; This option is available only when aligning in the plugin and 
      for K2 frames only.&nbsp; It is relevant there when acquiring a gain-normalized 
      image with an 'early return', and when using the GPU.&nbsp; In all other cases, the plugin passes a 
      gain-normalized image to the framealign module in its original floating point 
      form, before possibly scaling it to integers.&nbsp; With an early return, the 
      plugin has to fetch frames from DM as fast as possible and store them in a local 
      stack.&nbsp; By default the stack is in a scaled form (byte for 
      super-resolution, 2-byte integer for counting mode).&nbsp; With this option 
      checked, counting mode frames will be saved in their floating point form, and 
      super-resolution frames will be multiplied by 4096 and saved as 2-byte integers, 
      so the precision will be fully preserved, but the stack will occupy twice the 
      memory.&nbsp; Choosing this option may delay the early return unless there is 
      enough memory.&nbsp; When using a GPU, the plugin will do the usual scaling of 
      frames to bytes or 2-byte integers before copying to the GPU, in order to reduce 
      the copying time and allow more frames to be stacked on the GPU between the 
      alignment and summing steps.&nbsp; With this option, floating point numbers will 
      be copied, which will take longer and limit the number of frames that can be 
      stack.&nbsp; However, this option is overridden by the option to scale 
      saved frames by an additional factor of 100; if there is an early return or GPU 
      use and 
      frames are being saved with such scaling, the scaled frames will be passed to 
      the framealign module.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Output aligned sums as floating point</b></p>
    <p>
      This option is available only when aligning in IMOD.&nbsp; Select the checkbox 
      to have aligned sums output as floating point instead of 2-byte integer, which 
      will preserve a very small amount of precision in the sums.&nbsp; The regular scaling 
      will still be applied to them in this case.</p>
