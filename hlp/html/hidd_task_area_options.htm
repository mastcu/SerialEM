      Dialog</FONT></B></P>
    <P> This dialog
      allows you to select which Low Dose area is used for some tasks.&nbsp; Each 
      operation shown here has a choice between a specific area and &#39;View or Search&#39;; 
      in the latter case, the program will use View if it has large enough field of 
      View, but use Search if it is not in LM and has a suitable field of view while 
      View does not.</P>
     <P><B>Rough eucentricity, if started in LM and Search is in LM</B></P>
      <P>Select between using the View or Search area (as described 
        above) for the rough
        eucentricity procedure and using the Search area, if it is
        defined as being in low magnification <em>and</em> if the microscope is already
        in low magnification.&nbsp; Running this procedure in LM may be accurate enough
        for some purposes, so this option allows it to be run with the Search area
        without losing the time involved in leaving low magnification just for this
        purpose.</P>
      <P><B>Refine eucentricty</B></P>
      <P>Select whether the Trial area rather than the View or 
        Search area will
        be used for the tilted images that are taken when refining eucentricity. The
        View or Search area will still be used for the initial and final tracking images when the
        Refine and Realign procedure is used, and for the rough eucentricity procedure
        when both rough and fine procedures are run together. Using the Trial area will
        save a little dose but will reduce the range of Z heights over which the
        procedure can run reliably. Also, if the specimen is not relatively flat along
        the tilt axis, the Trial area rather than the Record area will be brought to
        the eucentric height.</P>
    <P><strong>Reset image shift &amp; realign</strong></P>
    <P>Select whether to use the View or Search area versus the Trial area for the Reset
        IS &amp; Realign procedure. The View or Search area is the default because the stage
        movement involved in resetting the shift is unpredictable, and the larger field
        of view of the View area is assumed to be needed to do the reset reliably. It
        may be safe to use the trial area if your limit for resetting image shift is
        small (~1 micron), if the field of view of the trial area is fairly large (2
        microns), and if your stage is adjusted so that stage movements are reliable at
        high tilt for the holder being used.</P>
    <P><strong>Walkup</strong></P>
    <P>Select whether the Walk Up routine will be run with the
        View or Search area instead of the Trial area.</P>
    <P><strong>Use View for tasks even if Search is a better size</strong></P>
    <P>Toggle this option to prevent the program from choosing between using View and 
      Search based on field of View, as explained above, and using the View area 
      regardless of its suitability.&nbsp; In addition to the tasks listed above and 
      rough eucentricity started outside of LM, this choice is made for Reverse Tilt, 
      Tilt after Stage Move, Adjust Backlash, Assess Angle Range, and Condition Phase 
      Plate, and the anchor image in bidirectional tilt series.</P>
