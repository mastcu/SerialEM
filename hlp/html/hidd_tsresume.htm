    <P>This dialog box allows you to resume a tilt series that has stopped, and to 
      control the point at which it will be resumed. It also lets you indicate that 
      you have changed the image alignment.</P>
    <P><B>Next action in sequence</B></P>
    <P>The dialog box starts with a message describing what action will occur if you 
      simply resume with the next action. Certain events will make the program back 
      up and repeat steps that have already occurred at the current tilt. Such 
      changes will already be reflected in this message.</P>
    <P><B>Choose one option for continuing</B></P>
    <P>This set of radio buttons presents the set of options for how the program will 
      resume. Inappropriate options will be disabled. When montaging, the options 
      will refer to taking a montage rather than taking a Record image. Depending 
      upon where you are in the tit series loop, some of the options may involve 
      going back and repeating steps, whereas others may skip steps that you have 
      managed by hand. Any time that you select an option that will save a Record 
      image, this image will overwrite any existing image at the current tilt angle.</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        Resume with next action in sequence - This will be the action described in the 
        message at the top of the dialog box</LI>
      <LI>
        Go on to next tilt - This option will not be available unless you have finished 
        all actions at the current tilt angle. It could be used to prevent the program 
        from taking a new Record image and overwriting the one in the file.</LI>
      <LI>
        Save the Record image in Buffer A - Use this option if you have taken a new 
        Record image that you want saved.</LI>
      <LI>
        Take new Record image and save it - Use this option to have a new Record image 
        taken for you and saved to file. The program will skip any scheduled tracking 
        and focusing steps.</LI>
      <LI>
        Autofocus then take Record image - Use this option to start with the 
        autofocusing step.</LI>
      <LI>
        Track, autofocus, and take Record image - Use this option to start with the 
        tracking step.</LI>
      <LI>
        Low mag track, autofocus, and take Record image - If you have low magnification 
        tracking enabled, this option is also available to let you resume with a low 
        magnification tracking image.</LI></OL>
    <P><B>Specify other conditions</B></P>
    <P>Select the option 'Use image in buffer A as reference for alignments' if you 
      have changed the alignment and taken an image at the new alignment. The program 
      will move this image into the autoalign buffer (D) to replace the existing 
      reference. In low dose mode, this new reference can be from either the Record 
      area or the Trial area; the program will move it into the appropriate buffer (D 
      or E) to replace the respective reference, and avoid using the image in the 
      other alignment buffer for alignment.</P>
    <P><B>Action Buttons</B></P>
    <P>The GO button will resume te tilt series unconditionally; the One Loop button 
      will make it stop after finishing all actions at one tilt; the One Step button 
      will execute one step; and the Cancel button will just close the dialog box.</P>
