        Dose Symmetric Tilt Series Parameters Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog allows you to set parameters for acquiring a dose-symmetric tilt 
        series, where images are taken on alternating sides of zero tilt so as to 
        minimize the accumulated electron dose on low-tilt images.&nbsp; More background 
        and details on this tilting method are available in
        <a href="about_tilt_series.htm#doseSymmetric">Acquiring Tilt Series</a>.&nbsp; In this dialog, 
        the set of images taken contiguously on one side of the series is referred to as 
        a &#39;group&#39;.</p>
      <p><strong>Initial group size</strong></p>
      <p>Use the spinner to select the size of the groups at the start of the series.&nbsp; 
          For example, with a size of 2, images would be take at angles 0, -2, -4, +2, +4, 
          -6, -8, 6, 8, etc.</p>
      <p><strong>Increase group size beyond an angle</strong></p>
      <p>Select this option to have groups increase in size once the angle specified in 
          the text box is reached.&nbsp; This angle is relative to the initial angle of 
          the tilt series, which need not be zero and is specified in the angle text box 
          for the <strong>Run series in two directions from</strong>&#39; option of the main 
          tilt series setup dialog.&nbsp; For exmaple, with an initial angle of 10 and an 
          entry of 15 here, the groups would begin to increase in size at -5 and 25 
          degrees.</p>
      <p><strong>Increase group size by n every m degrees</strong></p>
      <p>With an increase in group size enabled, use the spinner to set how much the 
          group size should increase when the criterion angle is reached, and the text box to set the angular increment at which the group size should increase by 
          the same amount thereafter.&nbsp; Set the increment to 0 or to a large 
          number to prevent further increases in group size after the first one.</p>
      <p><strong>Stop alternating directions beyond an angle</strong></p>
      <p>Select this option to convert to unidirectional tilting once the angle in the 
          text box is reached and run to the terminal angle of the series on the first 
          side, then on the second side.&nbsp; This angle is also relative to the initial 
          angle of the series.&nbsp; The unidirectional tilting starts at the end of a 
          group, not necessarily at the angle specified.</p>
      <p><strong>Use View anchor if first unidirectional part has &gt;= n tilts</strong></p>
      <p>Use this option to use an anchor image to guarantee returning from the end of the 
          first unidirectional segment to the beginning of the final unidirectional 
          segment.&nbsp; Such an anchor image would ordinarily not be needed with dose 
          symmetric tilting, but could be used if the unidirectional segments are 
          sufficiently time-consuming and circumstances are less than ideal (e.g., large 
          sample drift or poor stage performance).&nbsp; Use the spinner to set a minimum 
          size for the unidirectional part below which an anchor will not be used.&nbsp; 
          An anchor will also not be used if the first unidirectional segment is not 
          bigger than the largest alternating group size.&nbsp; Note that only View images 
          can be used for anchors, unlike for regular bidirectional series.</p>
      <p><strong>Reorder file when finished</strong></p>
      <p>SerialEM can produce an image file and associated &#39;.mdoc&#39; file with tilt angles 
          in order from a dose-symmetric series.&nbsp; Unlike a bidirectional series, the 
          tilt series file cannot be rewritten in order until the whole series is done, 
          namely when it is terminated.&nbsp; Whether this reordering takes away from 
          acquisition time depends on whether saving in the background is disabled in the 
          SerialEM properties file with the property &#39;BackgroundSaveToFile 0&#39;.&nbsp; If 
          background saving is enabled, the option will be labeled <strong>Reorder file in 
          background when finished (allowing other operations)</strong>, which means that 
          manual and automatic acquisitions can proceed unimpeded.&nbsp; Otherwise, it 
          will be labeled <strong>Reorder file synchronously when finished (blocking other 
          operations)</strong>, which means that nothing else can happen while the program 
          is reading and rewriting the file.</p>
      <p><strong>Summary lines</strong></p>
      <p>The first line at the bottom summarizes the tilt strategy, showing the actual 
          angles at which the transition in group size and to unidirectional tilting will 
          occur.&nbsp; Again, these are all relative to the initial angle of the tilt 
          series.&nbsp; The second line shows how many tilt reversals there are, and the 
          total amount of tilting that they involve, which would govern both the 
          additional time and the extra wear imposed on the goniometer by using 
          dose-symmetric tilting.</p>
