    <p>
      This panel contains options for controlling various aspects of program behavior 
      in STEM mode.</p>
    <p>
      <b>STEM Mode</b></p>
    <p>
      The checkbox can be used to enter and leave STEM mode, and will also be checked 
      when the microscope is put into STEM mode by other means.&nbsp; After the <b>
      STEM mode</b> text appears an indicator, which is just OFF or ON on a JEOL, but 
      is OFF, NANO, or MICRO on an FEI scope to indicate whether nanoprobe or 
      microprobe mode is selected.&nbsp; The button will remain checked and the 
      indicator will show the same state even if STEM mode is temporarily suspended by 
      checking the <b>TEM mode when screen down</b> option.&nbsp; Thus, this button 
      reflects whether the program, not the scope, is in STEM mode.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Unblank</b></p>
    <p>
      This button can be used to unblank the beam when it is being maintained in a 
      blanked state by SerialEM.&nbsp; It will unblank both the blanking imposed by 
      checking <b>BLANK BEAM in STEM mode</b> and the blanking managed by the SerialEM 
      Low Dose module.&nbsp; It is enabled when the beam is blanked.</p>
    <p>
      <b>BLANK BEAM in STEM mode</b></p>
    <p>
      This option can be used to keep the beam blanked whenever the microscope itself 
      is in STEM mode.&nbsp; The beam is, of course, unblanked for image acquisition, 
      and will be unblanked if you press <b>Unblank</b>.&nbsp; This option would be 
      needed to keep the beam blanked even if the program is in Low Dose mode, unless 
      you keep the screen up or have <b>BLANK BEAM when screen down</b> checked in the 
      Low Dose control panel.</p>
    <p>
      TEM mode when screen down</p>
    <p>
      When this option is checked, the program will place the microscope in TEM mode 
      whenever the screen is down.&nbsp; The option is cleared by an image 
      acquisition.&nbsp; This capability could be useful for checking the specimen on 
      the screen, at least on FEI scopes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Invert contrast</b></p>
    <p>
      When this box is checked, some or all STEM images will have their contrast 
      inverted, which may reduce mental strain when one is used to looking at TEM 
      images.&nbsp; The behavior, and the text of the button, depends on the setting 
      for the property 'InvertBrightField'.&nbsp; If the property is 1 (the default 
      value), the button reads <b>Invert contrast of image data</b> and all images 
      will be inverted when the box is checked.&nbsp; If the property is set to 0 or 
      -1, the text is <b>Invert contrast unless Bright Field</b> and Bright Field 
      images will either never be inverted (for value 0) or be inverted when this 
      option is NOT selected (for value -1).&nbsp; (More precisely, this behavior 
      applies to images taken with a detector whose name starts with 'Bright'.)</p>
    <p>
      <b>Retract to stop camera blanking</b></p>
    <p>
      CCD cameras will typically blank the beam unless the screen is down.&nbsp; There 
      are two ways to defeat this blanking in STEM mode: retracting the camera, and 
      lowering the screen.&nbsp; This button can be used to specify that camera(s) 
      should be retracted when taking a STEM picture, rather than lowering the screen.&nbsp; 
      The default is for the program to lower the screen when necessary for taking an 
      image, unless this option is selected.&nbsp; That behavior is controlled by a 
      property, 'LowerScreenForSTEM', which can be set either to prevent the screen 
      lowering or to make it happen when the scope enters STEM mode. Another property, 
      'MustUnblankWithScreen', can be set to indicate that camera retraction cannot be 
      used to defeat blanking (e.g., for a nonretractable camera), in which case the 
      option here is disabled.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Match pixel size when switching</b></p>
    <p>
      Select this option to have the program change magnification when entering or 
      leaving STEM mode so as to maintain approximately the same pixel size for STEM 
      and CCD acquisition.&nbsp; A camera property, 'PixelMatchFactor', can be set to 
      make binned pixels in one mode match unbinned pixels in the other, e.g., in 
      order to match the field of view instead of the unbinned pixel sizes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Added STEM rotation</b></p>
    <p>
      Entering a nonzero angle here will rotate the acquired image (counterclockwise 
      for positive angles).&nbsp; This field is used during program setup and may be 
      useful for isolated image acquisition.&nbsp; However, rotating the images will 
      make image and stage shift calibrations inaccurate and move the scan away from 
      parallel to the tilt axis, thus impairing dynamic focusing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Set Zero of IS</b> (JEOL only)</p>
    <p>
      This button can be used to reset the zero of the image shift on a JEOL, which is 
      actually a beam shift.&nbsp; It may be needed if the program fails to set the 
      zero correctly the first time it sees STEM mode.&nbsp; It would also be used if 
      the scope alignment is changed in a way that moves the center of the focused 
      area.</p>
