    <P>This dialog allows you to store and return to a set of microscope settings and 
      Record parameters. It distinguishes between two kinds of states:</P>
    <P><B><I>Imaging states:</I></B> An imaging state consists of the state of the 
      microscope together with the parameters used to acquire a Record image. 
      Specifically, the state includes the magnification, spot size, intensity, probe 
      mode for an FEI scope, and 
      energy filter settings if any (slit in/out, slit width, energy loss, whether to 
      do zero loss). The state 
      also includes whether Low Dose mode is on; in fact, if it is, then the stored 
      state consists of all of the settings of the Record area. The acquisition 
      parameters include the camera, binning, exposure time, frame size, drift 
      settling, and type of shuttering and processing, as well as whether subframes 
      are being stored from a direct detector.&nbsp; For a K2 camera, parameters also 
      include the read mode (linear, counting, super-resolution), the frame time, 
      whether alignment is being done, the type of alignment (in DM, SEMCCD plugin, or 
      IMOD), and the index of the frame alignment parameter set.</P>
    <P><B><I>Map Acquire states:</I> </B>A map acquire state consists of all the 
      parameters needed to acquire more maps of the same kind as a given Navigator 
      map. This state includes both an imaging state and the file where maps are to 
      be saved, which can be a montage. Since maps are not acquired in low dose mode, 
      the imaging state must be in regular mode.</P>
    <P>The dialog shows a table of imaging states that are saved with your settings. 
      The essential properties of the state are summarized in the table: 'LD' if it 
      is a Low Dose state, camera number, magnification, spot size, intensity as a 
      percent C2/C3 value, exposure time, binning, and frame size in 1000's (e.g., 
      2048 x 1536 shows up as 2.0x1.5). Clicking a line in the table selects the 
      current line in the table, and double clicking actually sets the state.</P>
    <P><B>Add Current State</B></P>
    <P>This buttons adds the current microscope and Record parameters as a new imaging 
      state in the table.</P>
    <P><B>Add Nav Item State</B></P>
    <P>This button adds the imaging state used to acquire the current Navigator item as 
      a new line in the table. This is not a map acquire state, so the file where the 
      map was saved is irrelevant. This button can be used to convert the 'Stock 
      states' that could be saved in a Navigator file in previous versions of 
      SerialEM. Open the stock state file in the Navigator, select each item in turn 
      in the Navigator and press this button to add its state to the table.</P>
    <P><B>Delete</B></P>
    <P>This button deletes the current line of the table.</P>
    <P><B>Update</B></P>
    <P>This button updates the state in the current line of the table with the current 
      microscope and Record parameters.</P>
    <P><B>Name</B></P>
    <P>You can enter a name for the current state in the table with this text box.</P>
    <P><B>(Set) Imaging</B></P>
    <P>This button will change the microscope and Record settings to the imaging state 
      on the current line of the table. It is equivalent to double clicking on a line 
      of the table. If the selected state is a low-dose state, then the parameters of 
      the Low Dose Record area will be replaced by the parameters of the stored 
      state. After setting one imaging state, you can still use this button to set a 
      different state, without first returning to the pre-existing imaging state.</P>
    <P><B>(Set) Map Acquire</B></P>
    <P>This button is enabled if the Navigator is open and the current item there is a 
      map. It will change the microscope and Record parameters to the state used to 
      acquire that map, and make the file where that map is stored be the current 
      file (opening it if necessary). Once you have set a map acquire state, you can 
      only return from it, not set a different map acquire or imaging state.</P>
    <P><B>(Set) Scheduled</B></P>
    <P>This button is enabled if the current Navigator item is marked for acquisition 
      and there is a stored imaging state scheduled to be set when that item is ready 
      to be acquired. Press this button to revisit and check the stored state. If you 
      need to change some properties of the scheduled state, you can make the change 
      then press the Imaging State button in the Navigator to update the state that 
      will be set.</P>
    <P><B>Restore Prior State</B></P>
    <P>The button restores all settings to what they were before a state was set by any 
      of the above means. If the imaging state was set two or more times in 
      succession, the system is returned to the condition it was in before state was 
      set the first time, not to the state just before the last one. If you are 
      leaving a map acquire state, the file that was current prior to entering that 
      state will be made current again, and the file associated with that map state 
      will be closed again if it was opened
    </P>
    <P><B>Forget Prior State</B></P>
    <P>Use this button to make the current state the one that will be returned to after 
      going to new states and restoring from them. In other words, the program will 
      forget that you changed state. You are then free to select a new map acquire 
      state without returning from the current state.</P>
