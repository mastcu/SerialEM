      <P>This panel allows you to see and control how image intensities are displayed. 
        When an image is acquired or read from a file, pixels are sampled over a 
        particular area to determine how to scale the intensities for display. The 
        program finds the lower and upper intensities beyond which only a certain small 
        fraction of pixels have intensities, and stretches the contrast to map these 
        limiting intensities to 0 and 255 in an intermediate byte image used for 
        display. This byte image is displayed with a second mapping determined by the 
        Brightness and Contrast sliders; 0 and 255 display as black and white on the screen 
        when these sliders are in the middle position. These limiting values of the 
        first mapping are shown 
        in the Black and White text boxes. You can control the size of the area that 
        will be analyzed, as well as the percent of pixels whose intensities will be 
        saturated at each extreme. You can also simply change the black and white 
        values directly. Nothing you do in this window will affect the pixel values 
        that get saved to a file.</P>
      <P><B>Black and White level sliders and text boxes</B></P>
      <P>The text boxes show the image intensities that map to 0 and 255, and which then 
        display to black and white 
        on the screen with Brightness and Contrast in the middle position. The sliders 
        are tied to these values, and the range of the sliders corresponds to minimum 
        and maximum image intensities estimated by sampling the entire image.&nbsp; 
        Because the sampling can miss bright pixels cause by X-rays, the latter values 
        are typically not the same as the minimum and maximum intensities in the image, which you 
        can determine with the <A HREF="menu_process.htm#hid_process_minmaxmean">Min/Max/Mean</A> 
        command in the Process menu. You can adjust the sliders or enter new values in 
        the boxes to control 
        the degree of saturation at the extreme values in the image.&nbsp; You can enter 
        values beyond the range of the sliders as well.</P>
    <P>Note that these sliders do not correspond to the Black and White sliders in 
      3dmod; rather, they are similar to the High and Low sliders that appear when 
      3dmod is opened with the option to store values internally as 16-bit integers.</P>
      <P><B>Brightness and Contrast sliders</B></P>
      <P>Use these sliders to adjust the brightness and contrast settings of the display 
        for the current image. Different images can have different brightness/contrast 
        settings. A newly acquired image will inherit its settings from the previous 
        image in the A buffer. If an image appears saturated at a uniform gray level 
        after adjusting these sliders, you probably need to adjust the Black or White 
        levels to see detail in these regions. If a bright area appears saturated, try 
        raising the White level; if a dark area is saturated, lower the Black level.</P>
      <P><B>Zoom</B></P>
      <P>The text box displays the image zoom and allows a zoom value to be entered 
        directly. The up and down arrows allow you to increase or decrease the zoom.&nbsp; 
        The -/_ and =/+ hot keys and the mouse scroll wheel are more convenient for this 
        purpose.</P>
      <P><B>Cross</B></P>
      <P>When this option is selected, the program will always draw a large red cross in 
        the center of the display, not just when shifting with the mouse.</P>
      <P><b>Invert</b></P>
    <P>Use this button to invert the image contrast; the hot key F11 can also be used.</P>
      <P><B>Set Truncation</B></P>
      <P>Use this button to enter new values for the percent of pixels that will have 
        their intensities truncated at the low and the high end of the intensity range, 
        and new values controlling how FFTs are scaled. 
        You will enter four dialog boxes for entering new values. The first two are for 
        entering the percent of pixels truncated at the low and high end of the range.&nbsp; 
        The next one is the mean gray level that FFTs shuold have at their edges when 
        first displayed.&nbsp; Values in the range of 16 to 64 may be useful, although 
        the actual perceived gray level will depend on how noisy the FFTs are.&nbsp; An 
        entry of 0 here will disable the special scaling of FFTs. The final text box 
        sets the relative diameter of a ring of pixels whose mean magnitude will be 
        displayed as white.&nbsp; Useful values are in the range of 0.002 to 0.025, 
        depending on whether there may be detail at the lowest frequencies that you want 
        to appear in the display.&nbsp; If any of these parameters are changed, the current image will 
        be re-analyzed and displayed with the new settings, which will apply for new images that are acquired.&nbsp; 
        Note that all of these parameters affect the setting of&nbsp; the Black and 
        White levels, which you can change if there is too much or not enough tuncation 
        of extreme values.</P>
      <P><B>Set Area Fraction</B></P>
      <P>Use this button to enter a new value for the fraction of image to analyze when 
        determining the Black and White levels. Enter a fraction of the linear extent 
        of the image. For example, if you enter 0.5, then only pixels from 256 to 768 
        in X and Y in a 1024 x 1024 pixel image will be analyzed, which is actually only 
        one-quarter of the image area.</P>
      <P><B>Scale Bars</B></P>
      <P>Use this button to turn the display of scale bars on or off.</P>
      <P><B>Autozoom</B></P>
      <P>When this option is selected, the display zoom will change automatically when 
        switching between images with different binning. This allows full-size and 
        binned images to be compared easily.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Antialias filtering for zoom &lt; 1</STRONG></P>
      <P>This button controls whether images zoomed down below 0.8 are scaled with a 
        filter that eliminates noise and artifacts from aliased information.&nbsp; 
        Aliasing occurs when an image&nbsp;is zoomed down by simply sub-sampling the 
        pixels; namely, information at frequencies higher than what can appear in the 
        scaled-down image appears as noise at other frequencies in the sub-sampled 
        image.&nbsp; The antialias filter removes frequencies above the new frequency 
        limit in the process of making the scaled down image.&nbsp; This process can 
        take several seconds for very large images; thus this option can be used to 
        turn off the filter.&nbsp; The filter is temporarily turned off when panning an 
        image with the left mouse button.</P>
