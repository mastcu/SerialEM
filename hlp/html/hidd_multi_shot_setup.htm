    Setup Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog allows you to set parameters for taking multiple Record images with 
      image shift used to center on a series of positions.&nbsp; The positions can be in a 
      circular pattern around the current position, which would generally be used for 
      taking multiple shots within a hole, or in designated positions relative to the 
      current position, which would generally be used for taking shots in multiple 
      holes.&nbsp; Both within-hole and between-hole images can be taken.&nbsp; The parameters are used in two ways: when acquiring the 
      images with the 'MultipleRecords' script command, and when displaying the 
      positions as a pattern of circles representing the beam on an image (e.g., a 
      lower-magnification map).&nbsp; The latter display occurs when this dialog is 
      open, and also when the 'Show Acquire 
      area' checkbox in the Navigator dialog is turned on and the display 
      is enabled with the <a href="#hid_options_showmulti">Show Shots when 
            Show Acquire</a> option in the Navigator - Montaging & Grids submenu.&nbsp; 
      When the relevant parameters here are changed, these changes will appear 
      immediately in the display.</p>
    <p>It is important to realize that if the image areas are being displayed on a Low 
      Dose View image with a large defocus offset, the positions and sizes may be 
      misleading.</p>
    <p><i><b>Saving Accurate Image Shift Values for Holes</b></i></p>
    <p>There are several possible methods of setting the image shift values for the 
      holes, ranging from centering holes in an image where they are all visible 
      (e.g., low dose View), through centering consistent positions at a magnification 
      still lower than the Record mag, to centering positions at the Record mag 
      itself.&nbsp; Your choice depends on how accurate the positioning needs to be 
      (more accuracy is needed for holes at more distant image shifts or if multiple 
      shots are to be taken inside the holes), and on how well image shift positions 
      correspond between the Record mag and the mag where they are defined (a constant 
      offset is not a problem, scaling or rotation is).&nbsp; You can try an easier 
      method first and see if it is adequate for your situation.&nbsp; See the section 
      at the end of this page on how to assess that point .</p>
    <p>The goal is the save image shifts at <i>consistent</i> positions, not 
      necessarily the ones at the center of the holes, because only the differences 
      between shifts matter.&nbsp; It is just as good to save the shift at the edge of 
      each hole, if a corresponding point on the edge can be picked accurately enough.&nbsp; 
      Here are two methods of positioning along a diagonally oriented part of a hole 
      edge:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shift the image so that the hole edge intersects the center of the display 
        (turn on the cross to see this).&nbsp; Note where the hole edge intersects the 
        two edges of the image.&nbsp; While keeping the edge on the cross, shift the 
        image to equalize the two distances from each edge intersection point to the 
        nearby corner of the image.&nbsp; Alternatively,move those two intersection 
        points to distances from the corners that can be recognized and reproduced on 
        successive holes, perhaps by making one go through the corner. </li>
      <li>Shift the image so that the hole edge intersects opposite corners of the 
        image.&nbsp; Note the distance from the hole edge to the image center on the 
        first hole and try to reproduce that difference on successive holes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of these methods require the Navigator to be open and suggest that you add 
      a group of points on an image at the locations where you want to save image 
      shift values.&nbsp; This step is helpful if you have more than a 2x2 pattern of 
      holes, to avoid losing track of which hole you are on. You should add those 
      points in the order in which their positions will be saved (see &#39;Save Image 
      Shift Values at Holes&#39; below.)&nbsp; When you press the 
      button to start saving image shift values, the Navigator buttons on the left 
      change, &#39;Go To XY&#39; and &#39;Go To Marker&#39; change to &#39;IS to XY&#39; and &#39;IS to Marker&#39; 
      respectively.&nbsp; They can be used to move to marked positions with image 
      instead of stage shift.&nbsp; The same operation can be done with the 'IS to Nav 
      Pt' button in this dialog.</p>
    <p>
      <i>1) Centering holes at a lower mag.</i>&nbsp; In order for image shift 
      positions to correspond well enough between this mag and the record mag, this 
      operation must be done near focus (within about 20 microns).&nbsp; Assuming that 
      you use View images, the steps are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce the View defocus offset to the lowest level that you need to see the 
        holes.</li>
      <li>Take a View image.</li>
      <li>If image shift range is a concern, first shift the image with the right mouse 
        button to center the pattern, and reset the image shift if necessary.</li>
      <li>Add a set of Navigator points at the centers of the holes, in the order 
        required when shifting to the holes (see below).&nbsp; If necessary, take a new 
        View image to see the required positions.</li>
      <li>Press the relevant button to start saving image shifts.</li>
      <li>Press the &#39;IS to Nav Pt&#39; button in this dialog, or select the first added point in the Navigator and press &#39;Go To IS&#39; 
        there.</li>
      <li>Take a View image, center with the right mouse button, and take another to 
        check the centering.</li>
      <li>When centered, press the &#39;Save Image Shift&#39; button.</li>
      <li>Press the &#39;IS to Nav Pt&#39; button in this dialog, or select the next added point in the Navigator and press &#39;Go To IS&#39; 
        there.</li>
      <li>Take a View and center the image.</li>
      <li>Press &#39;Save Image Shift&#39;.</li>
      <li>Repeat the last three steps for each other point.</li>
      <li>Restore the View defocus offset.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This method can be accurate to within 1% on a scope with good correspondence 
      between View and Record positions, but can be off by a lot.</p>
    <p>
      2) 
      <i>Picking consistent positions at an intermediate mag where it is still easy to 
      find the hole.</i>&nbsp; Even if you cannot 
      use the View mag, you will probably get accurate positions at some mag closer to 
      the Record mag (e.g., half the mag), because image shifts are likely to be 
      consistent at higher mags.&nbsp; You will probably be able to use this method 
      without changing the View defocus offset, but you will need to change the Record 
      mag.&nbsp; The steps are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Take a View image.</li>
      <li>If image shift range is a concern, first shift the image with the right mouse 
        button to center the pattern, and reset the image shift if necessary.</li>
      <li>Add a set of Navigator points in the right order, either at the centers of the 
        holes (if you think you can define those at the intermediate mag), or at an edge 
        at +/-45 or +/-135 degrees.</li>
      <li>Press the relevant button to start saving image shifts.</li>
      <li>Press the &#39;IS to Nav Pt&#39; button in this dialog, or select the first added point in the Navigator and press &#39;Go To IS&#39; 
        there.</li>
      <li>Press the &#39;Record&#39; radio button in the Low Dose control panel to go to Record 
        mode, turn on continuous update, and change the mag to the chosen value.</li>
      <li>Take a Record or Preview image and shift it to either center the hole or 
        position the chosen quadrant of the edge.</li>
      <li>Press &#39;Save Image Shift&#39;.</li>
      <li>Press the &#39;IS to Nav Pt&#39; button in this dialog, or select the next added point in the Navigator and press &#39;Go To IS&#39; 
        there.</li>
      <li>Take a Record or Preview and shift it to the same position as for the first 
        point.</li>
      <li>Press &#39;Save Image Shift&#39;.</li>
      <li>Repeat the last three steps for each other point.</li>
      <li>Restore the Record mag.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      3) <i>Picking consistent positions at the Record mag.</i>&nbsp; This method is 
      guaranteed to give accurate image shift values, as long as you can define 
      consistent positions.&nbsp; If you think that you can position edges well 
      enough, then the procedure is the same as just described, except that you do not 
      need to change the Record mag.&nbsp; However, if you have difficulty finding the 
      holes, you may need to reduce the View defocus offset close to zero.&nbsp; This 
      will likely throw off the View shift offset, and you might need to adjust that 
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      An alternative to positioning edges is to take a Prescan montage at the Record 
      mag big enough to show the whole hole, and center that.&nbsp; This may be 
      reasonably fast, especially if you use continuous mode with a K2 camera.&nbsp; 
      The steps are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select File - New Montage.</li>
      <li>Turn off &#39;Use View in Low Dose mode&#39; and &#39;Use Search in Low Dose mode&#39;</li>
      <li>Select the number of pieces that will make an image bigger than a hole.</li>
      <li>For a K2 camera, turn on the option to &#39;Use continuous mode&#39; and set the 
        settling factor to at least 0.75.</li>
      <li>If necessary, adjust the exposure time of the Record parameters, or of the 
        Mont-Map parameter set if you selected the option to use that.</li>
      <li>Follow all the steps in method 2 above through pressing the &#39;IS to Nav Pt&#39; button.</li>
      <li>Press &#39;Prescan&#39; in the Montage control panel.</li>
      <li>Shift the overview image in the buffer B to center the hole.&nbsp; Take 
        another Prescan if necessary.</li>
      <li>Press &#39;Save Image Shift&#39;.</li>
      <li>Press the &#39;IS to Nav Pt&#39; button in this dialog, or select the next added point in the Navigator and press &#39;Go To IS&#39; 
        there.</li>
      <li>Take a Prescan and center it.</li>
      <li>Press &#39;Save Image Shift&#39;.</li>
      <li>Repeat the last three steps for each other point.</li>
      <li>Restore any parameters that you changed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b><i>The Dialog Controls</i></b></p>
    <p><b>Do multiple Records within each hole</b></p>
    <p>Select this checkbox to take images in a circular pattern, with no control over 
      their angles.&nbsp; The relevant controls will appear when it is selected.</p>
    <p><b>Number of shots around center</b></p>
    <p>Select a value between 2 and 12 for the number of Records taken in off-center 
      positions.</p>
    <p><b>Shot in center</b></p>
    <p>With these radio buttons, you can include a shot in the center of the pattern, 
      which should be possible with 6 or more off-center shots.&nbsp; The centered 
      shot can be taken either before or after the off-center shots.&nbsp; Although 
      taking it may involve one more delay for image shift settling, it is reported 
      that this shot will have less drift when taken after the others.</p>
    <p><b>Distance from center to off-center shots</b></p>
    <p>Distance from the center position to the off-center positions, in microns.&nbsp; 
      This distance must be at least as big as the beam diameter to avoid exposing 
      overlapping areas in more than one Record shot.&nbsp; If the multi-shot circles 
      are being displayed, press tab or Enter to have the image redrawn after entering 
      a new distance.</p>
    <p><b>Do Records in multiple holes</b></p>
    <p>Select this checkbox to take Records in either a rectangular grid of positions 
      or a series of arbitrary, &#39;custom&#39; positions around the current center position.&nbsp; 
      The relevant controls will appear when it is selected.</p>
    <p><b>Multiplier of usual delay after shifting to hole</b></p>
    <p>SerialEM has a built-in settling time after image shift that depends on the 
      size of the shift; it is probably inadequate at high magnification.&nbsp; The 
      factor entered here increases this settling time when shifting between holes; 
      the extra delay time described below is still added to the settling time.&nbsp; 
      This separate entrt allows you to have an adequate settling time when moving 
      between holes without having to make the extra delay for shots within a hole 
      bigger than necessary.</p>
    <p><b>Regular pattern of holes: n by n</b></p>
    <p>Use the two spinners to set the number of positions in the rectangular pattern.&nbsp; 
      These values must be set before recording the image shift values at the corners. 
      Once the spacing of the pattern is defined, the spinners can be changed to 
      acquire more or fewer holes at that spacing.</p>
    <p><b>Use custom pattern</b></p>
    <p>Select this checkbox to take images in an arbitrary set of positions specified 
      by shifting to a center location then to each acquisition position.</p>
    <p><b>Save Image Shift Values at Holes</b></p>
    <p>Press &#39;For Corners of Regular Pattern&#39; to start setting the image shifts needed 
      for a regular pattern, or &#39;For custom pattern&#39; to start setting the shifts for 
      arbitrary positions.&nbsp; After pressing one of these buttons, the label below 
      the next line of buttons will summarize what to do next.</p>
    <p>To set the corners of a regular pattern, you will save image shifts at 4 hole 
      positions, even if one of the spinners is set to 1.&nbsp; Start at one corner of 
      the pattern and save the position.&nbsp; Then shift by the needed number of 
      holes corresponding to the value of the first spinner (i.e., move by 2 holes if 
      the value is 3) and save that position.&nbsp; Shift by the number of holes 
      indicated by the second spinner, save, and shift back by the number of holes 
      along the first axis.&nbsp; If one of the spinners is set to 1, the program will 
      still expect you to shift by one hole along that axis.</p>
    <p>To set the positions in a custom pattern, shift to a center position for the 
      pattern and save the shift.&nbsp; When taking multiple Records, all the shifts 
      will be done relative to this position.&nbsp; Then shift to the first point to 
      be acquired and save that position.&nbsp; Repeat until the last point and press 
      &#39;End Pattern&#39;.</p>
    <p> See above for instructions on how to save sufficiently accurate shift values.</p>
      <p><b>IS to Nav Pt</b></p>
    <p>Press this button to move to the location of the current Navigator point 
      with image shift and then select the next point&nbsp; in the table.&nbsp; This saves you from 
      pressing &#39;IS to XY&#39; and selecting the next point in the Navigator window, extra 
      steps where you can lose track of whether you have changed the selection there.&nbsp; 
      Press this button on first starting the saving operation and immediately after 
      each &#39;Save Image Shift&#39;.&nbsp; The first time that you do so, the program looks 
      at how many points are in the current group and which one is selected.&nbsp; If 
      the first one is selected, or if you are defining a regular pattern and there 
      are 4 points, it will image shift to the first point in the group and select the 
      next one.&nbsp; Otherwise, it will ask you if you want to start from the 
      beginning and work forward, or start at the end and work backward (which is not 
      going to work for a custom group unless you marked the central point at the 
      end), or simply leave the selected point alone.&nbsp; </p>
    <p><b>End Pattern</b></p>
    <p>Press this button to end the entries when defining a custom pattern.&nbsp; It 
      can be pressed either after saving the last position, or without explicitly 
      saving it.&nbsp; The current image shift will be saved if it is different from 
      that of the last saved point.</p>
    <p><b>Abort</b></p>
    <p>Press this button to stop entering shifts and throw away all entries.</p>
    <p><b>Save Record image</b></p>
    <p>Select this option to have the Record image saved in the current file.&nbsp; 
      The option is disabled and its setting is irrelevant if an early return is 
      selected with no returned image.</p>
    <p><b>Early returns for K2</b></p>
    <p>This group of controls appears when there is a K2 camera available and allows 
      for SerialEM to resume operations as soon as possible after acquiring an image 
      with saved frames, the same as is accomplished with the script command 
      'EarlyReturnNextShot'.&nbsp; The radio buttons allow you to select to have an 
      early return only on the last shot, or on all shots.&nbsp; If post-exposure 
      actions are enabled for the camera (namely, if <A HREF="#hid_camera_postactions">Post-actions</A> 
      in the Camera menu is not grayed out and is selected), then image shift to the 
      next position will occur soon after the exposure is finished for each shot, 
      regardless of whether early return is selected, and it is slightly more 
      efficient not to do an early return except on the last shot.&nbsp; If 
      post-actions are not enabled, the early return will allow the program to do the 
      image shift sooner.</p>
    <p>In the text box in this group, enter the number of frames in the returned 
      image: 0 for none, a specific number of frames, or -1 for all the frames.</p>
    <p><b>Extra delay after image shift</b></p>
    <p>A standard amount of settling time is imposed after each image shift; the extra 
      delay entered here will be added to this settling time.</p>
    <p><b>Adjust beam tilt to compensate for image shift</b></p>
    <p>This option is enabled if you have calibrated the beam tilt needed for 
      coma-free alignment as a function of image shift with
      <a href="menu_calibration.htm#hid_focustuning_comavs">Coma vs. Image Shift</a> 
      in the Calibration - Focus &amp; Tuning submenu.&nbsp; If so, then beam tilt will be 
      adjusted appropriately for each Record position, and restored at the end.&nbsp; 
      In addition, the image shift present when starting the routine will also be 
      compensated for, unless the script command &#39;AdjustBeamTiltforIS&#39; was run or beam 
      tilt was adjusted by any of the image-shift setting commands that provide the 
      adjustment.&nbsp; The conditions under which the calibration was taken are shown on the following 
      line.&nbsp; For the adjustment to work accurately, the current beam intensity at 
      least should be close to what it was when the calibration was done.</p>
    <p><b>Diameter of circles to draw</b></p>
    <p>If the multi-shot circles are being displayed, the diameter of the circles is 
      set to the entered value in microns, unless the option described next is 
      selected to use the illuminated area on an FEI Titan.&nbsp; Press tab or Enter 
      to have the image redrawn after entering a new diameter.</p>
    <p><b>Use Record illuminated area for circles in Low Dose</b></p>
    <p>This option appears on an FEI Titan and allows the multi-shot circle display to 
      take its diameter from the illuminated area setting of the Record area when Low 
      Dose mode is on instead of from the value entered in this dialog.&nbsp; The 
      display will be updated dynamically as this illuminated area setting is changed.&nbsp; 
      This update works even while this dialog is option, provided that the scope is 
      in the Record area and &#39;Continuous update&#39; is check in the Low Dose Control 
      panel before opening the dialog, and illuminated area is changed with microscope 
      controls.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>For this option to be valuable rather than misleading, the illuminated area 
      readout must be fairly accurate in the range of interest, which may not be the 
      case.</p>
    <p><a NAME="testing"></a><i><b>Testing Image Location and Coma Adjustment</b></i></p>
    <p>Once positions are set up in this dialog, the script command &#39;TestNextMultiShot 
      1&#39; followed by &#39;MultipleRecords&#39; can be used to test whether image positions are 
      suitable, and &#39;TestNextMultiShot 2&#39; can be used to measure the amount of beam 
      tilt adjustment needed at various positions, either with or without an 
      adjustment for image shift.&nbsp; The details of this operation are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If shots are being taken only within a hole, then test images will be taken 
        only at each peripheral position, while beam tilt will be measured first in the 
        central position then at all peripheral positions.</li>
      <li>If shots are being taken in multiple holes, images or beam tilt measurements 
        will be taken in the centers of holes only.</li>
      <li>When a regular hole pattern is selected, the four corners of the pattern, or 
        two ends of a single line of holes, will be tested.</li>
      <li>When a custom pattern is selected, all holes in the pattern will be tested.</li>
      <li>Record images will be taken when testing images within a hole, or when testing 
        multiple holes if the current open file is not a montage.&nbsp; Most likely, 
        montages will be needed to test holes.</li>
      <li>Record images will be saved only if the option to save them is checked; 
        otherwise they will accumulate in the rolling buffers.&nbsp; In the latter case, 
        be sure to allow enough buffers to see all the images afterwards.</li>
      <li>The test with montages, open a new montage file with enough pieces to cover 
        the hole; it must not be in View mode or be done with stage shift.</li>
      <li>After saving montages or Record images, use the menu entry File - Read and use 
        the buttons in the dialog to inspect the images.</li>
    </ul>
