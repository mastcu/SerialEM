    Setup Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog allows you to set parameters for taking multiple Record images with 
      image shift used to center on a series of positions.&nbsp; The positions can be in a 
      circular pattern around the current position, which would generally be used for 
      taking multiple shots within a hole, or in designated positions relative to the 
      current position, which would generally be used for taking shots in multiple 
      holes.&nbsp; Both within-hole and between-hole images can be taken.&nbsp; The parameters are used in two ways: when acquiring the 
      images with the 'MultipleRecords' script command, and when displaying the 
      positions as a pattern of circles representing the beam on an image (e.g., a 
      lower-magnification map).&nbsp; The latter display occurs when this dialog is 
      open, and also when the 'Show Acquire 
      area' checkbox in the Navigator dialog is turned on and the display 
      is enabled with the <a href="#hid_options_showmulti">Show Shots when 
            Show Acquire</a> option in the Navigator - Montaging & Grids submenu.&nbsp; 
      When the relevant parameters here are changed, these changes will appear 
      immediately in the display.</p>
    <p>It is important to realize that if the image areas are being displayed on a Low 
      Dose View image with a large defocus offset, the positions and sizes may be 
      misleading.</p>
    <p><b>Do multiple Records within each hole</b></p>
    <p>Select this checkbox to take images in a circular pattern, with no control over 
      their angles.&nbsp; The relevant controls will appear when it is selected.</p>
    <p><b>Number of shots around center</b></p>
    <p>Select a value between 2 and 12 for the number of Records taken in off-center 
      positions.</p>
    <p><b>Shot in center</b></p>
    <p>With these radio buttons, you can include a shot in the center of the pattern, 
      which should be possible with 6 or more off-center shots.&nbsp; The centered 
      shot can be taken either before or after the off-center shots.&nbsp; Although 
      taking it may involve one more delay for image shift settling, it is reported 
      that this shot will have less drift when taken after the others.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b>Distance from center to off-center shots</b></p>
    <p>Distance from the center position to the off-center positions, in microns.&nbsp; 
      This distance must be at least as big as the beam diameter to avoid exposing 
      overlapping areas in more than one Record shot.&nbsp; If the multi-shot circles 
      are being displayed, press tab or Enter to have the image redrawn after entering 
      a new distance.</p>
    <p><b>Do Records in multiple holes</b></p>
    <p>Select this checkbox to take Records in either a rectangular grid of positions 
      or a series of arbitrary, &#39;custom&#39; positions around the current center position.&nbsp; 
      The relevant controls will appear when it is selected.</p>
    <p><b>Multiplier of usual delay after shifting to hole</b></p>
    <p>SerialEM has a built-in settling time after image shift that depends on the 
      size of the shift; it is probably inadequate at high magnification.&nbsp; The 
      factor entered here increases this settling time when shifting between holes; 
      the extra delay time described below is still added to the settling time.&nbsp; 
      This separate entrt allows you to have an adequate settling time when moving 
      between holes without having to make the extra delay for shots within a hole 
      bigger than necessary.</p>
    <p><b>Regular pattern of holes: n by n</b></p>
    <p>Use the two spinners to set the number of positions in the rectangular pattern.&nbsp; 
      These values must be set before recording the image shift values at the 
      corners.Use </p>
    <p><b>Use custom pattern</b></p>
    <p>Select this checkbox to take images in an arbitrary set of positions specified 
      by shifting to a center location then to each acquisition position.</p>
    <p><b>Save Image Shift Values at Holes</b></p>
    <p>Press &#39;For Corners of Regular Pattern&#39; to start setting the image shifts needed 
      for a regular pattern, or &#39;For custom pattern&#39; to start setting the shifts for 
      arbitrary positions.&nbsp; After pressing one of these buttons, the label below 
      the next line of buttons will summarize what to do next.</p>
    <p>To set the corners of a regular pattern</p>
    <p><b>Save Record image</b></p>
    <p>Select this option to have the Record image saved in the current file.&nbsp; 
      The option is disabled and its setting is irrelevant if an early return is 
      selected with no returned image.</p>
    <p><b>Early returns for K2</b></p>
    <p>This group of controls appears when there is a K2 camera available and allows 
      for SerialEM to resume operations as soon as possible after acquiring an image 
      with saved frames, the same as is accomplished with the script command 
      'EarlyReturnNextShot'.&nbsp; The radio buttons allow you to select to have an 
      early return only on the last shot, or on all shots.&nbsp; If post-exposure 
      actions are enabled for the camera (namely, if <A HREF="#hid_camera_postactions">Post-actions</A> 
      in the Camera menu is not grayed out and is selected), then image shift to the 
      next position will occur soon after the exposure is finished for each shot, 
      regardless of whether early return is selected, and it is slightly more 
      efficient not to do an early return except on the last shot.&nbsp; If 
      post-actions are not enabled, the early return will allow the program to do the 
      image shift sooner.</p>
    <p>In the text box in this group, enter the number of frames in the returned 
      image: 0 for none, a specific number of frames, or -1 for all the frames.</p>
    <p><b>Extra delay after image shift</b></p>
    <p>A standard amount of settling time is imposed after each image shift; the extra 
      delay entered here will be added to this settling time.</p>
    <p><b>Adjust beam tilt to compensate for image shift</b></p>
    <p>This option is enabled if you have calibrated the beam tilt needed for 
      coma-free alignment as a function of image shift with
      <a href="menu_calibration.htm#hid_focustuning_comavs">Coma vs. Image Shift</a> 
      in the Calibration - Focus &amp; Tuning submenu.&nbsp; If so, then beam tilt will be 
      adjusted appropriately for each Record position, and restored at the end.&nbsp; 
      The conditions under which the calibration was taken are shown on the following 
      line.&nbsp; For the adjustment to work accurately, the current beam intensity at 
      least should be close to what it was when the calibration was done.</p>
    <p><b>Diameter of circles to draw</b></p>
    <p>If the multi-shot circles are being displayed, the diameter of the circles is 
      set to the entered value in microns, unless the option described next is 
      selected to use the illuminated area on an FEI Titan.&nbsp; Press tab or Enter 
      to have the image redrawn after entering a new diameter.</p>
    <p><b>Use Record illuminated area for circles in Low Dose</b></p>
    <p>This option appears on an FEI Titan and allows the multi-shot circle display to 
      take its diameter from the illuminated area setting of the Record area when Low 
      Dose mode is on instead of from the value entered in this dialog.&nbsp; The 
      display will be updated dynamically as this illuminated area setting is changed.&nbsp; 
      This update works even while this dialog is option, provided that the scope is 
      in the Record area and &#39;Continuous update&#39; is check in the Low Dose Control 
      panel before opening the dialog, and illuminated area is changed with microscope 
      controls.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>For this option to be valuable rather than misleading, the illuminated area 
      readout must be fairly accurate in the range of interest, which may not be the 
      case.</p>
