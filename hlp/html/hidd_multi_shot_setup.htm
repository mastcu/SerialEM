    Setup Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog allows you to set parameters for taking multiple Record images with
      image shift used to center on a series of positions.&nbsp; The positions can be in a
      circular pattern around the current position, which would generally be used for
      taking multiple shots within a hole, or in designated positions relative to the
      current position, which would generally be used for taking shots in multiple
      holes.&nbsp; Images can also be taken in two concentric rings of positions
      around the center.&nbsp; Both within-hole and between-hole images can be taken.&nbsp; The parameters are used in two ways: when acquiring the
      images with the 'MultipleRecords' script command, and when displaying the
      positions as a pattern of circles representing the beam on an image (e.g., a
      lower-magnification map).&nbsp; The latter display occurs when this dialog is
      open, and also when the 'Show Acquire
      area' checkbox in the Navigator dialog is turned on and the display
      is enabled with the <a href="menu_navigator.htm#hid_options_showmulti">Show Shots when
            Show Acquire</a> option in the Navigator - Montaging & Grids submenu.&nbsp;
      When the relevant parameters here are changed, these changes will appear
      immediately in the display.</p>
    <p>It is important to realize that if the image areas are being displayed on a Low
      Dose View image with a large defocus offset, the positions and sizes will be
      misleading unless the effects of defocus on magnification and image shift are 
      calibrated.</p>
    <p>If the stage is tilted, the program can respond in two ways.&nbsp; First, if the tilt angle
      is above 10 degrees, it
      will compensate for the differing heights of the positions by changing defocus;
      the change is determined from the tilt angle and the image shift at each
      position.&nbsp; The compensation is imperfect because the specimen may not be
      level at zero degrees, making the effective tilt angle when tilted different
      from the nominal one.&nbsp; Second, if the image shifts of multiple holes are
      defined at one tilt angle and acquisition is done at another angle, the program
      will adjust the positions appropriately.&nbsp; This adjustment is also imperfect&nbsp;for large differences in tilt angle but may be useful in some cases.</p>
    <p><i><b>Saving Accurate Image Shift Values for Holes</b></i></p>
    <p>If you have used the hole finder to mark hole positions, the best way of 
      getting image shift values may be to use the <b>Use Last Hole Vectors</b> button.&nbsp; 
      Since these vectors are stored as stage positions, they can be accurately 
      converted to image shift positions at the Record magnification even when they 
      were detected on a highly defocused View image (provided that the High Defocus 
      Magnification calibration has been done).&nbsp; Otherwise, there are several possible methods of setting the image shift values for the
      holes, ranging from centering holes in an image where they are all visible
      (e.g., low dose View), through centering consistent positions at a magnification
      still lower than the Record mag, to centering positions at the Record mag
      itself.&nbsp; Your choice depends on how accurate the positioning needs to be
      (more accuracy is needed for holes at more distant image shifts or if multiple
      shots are to be taken inside the holes), and on how well image shift positions
      correspond between the Record mag and the mag where they are defined (a constant
      offset is not a problem, scaling or rotation is).&nbsp; You can try an easier
      method first and see if it is adequate for your situation.&nbsp; See the section
      at the end of this page on how to assess that point .</p>
    <p>The goal is to save image shifts at <i>consistent</i> positions, not
      necessarily the ones at the center of the holes, because only the differences
      between shifts matter.&nbsp; It is just as good to save the shift at the edge of
      each hole, if a corresponding point on the edge can be picked accurately enough.&nbsp;
      Here are two methods of positioning along a diagonally oriented part of a hole
      edge:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shift the image so that the hole edge intersects the center of the display
        (turn on the cross to see this).&nbsp; Note where the hole edge intersects the
        two edges of the image.&nbsp; While keeping the edge on the cross, shift the
        image to equalize the two distances from each edge intersection point to the
        nearby corner of the image.&nbsp; Alternatively,move those two intersection
        points to distances from the corners that can be recognized and reproduced on
        successive holes, perhaps by making one go through the corner. </li>
      <li>Shift the image so that the hole edge intersects opposite corners of the
        image.&nbsp; Note the distance from the hole edge to the image center on the
        first hole and try to reproduce that difference on successive holes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The three methods below require the Navigator to be open and suggest that you add
      a group of points on an image at the locations where you want to save image
      shift values.&nbsp; In fact, this step would allow you to use the &#39;Use:&#39; <strong>Nav Pts</strong> 
      button to convert them directly to image shift vectors, followed by <strong>Step 
      To and Adjust IS</strong> to position the holes accurately at a chosen 
      magnification.&nbsp; This sequence should be easier and more flexible than the 
      procedures given next.&nbsp; Even if want to use those procedures, having 
      Navigator points is helpful when you have more than a 2x2 pattern of
      holes, to avoid losing track of which hole you are on. You should add those
      points in the order in which their positions will be saved (see &#39;Save Image
      Shift Values at Holes&#39; below.)&nbsp; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;If you are not using <strong>Nav Pts</strong> then <strong>Step To and 
      Adjust IS,</strong> then when you press the
      button to start saving image shift values, the Navigator buttons on the left
      change, &#39;Go To XY&#39; and &#39;Go To Marker&#39; change to &#39;IS to XY&#39; and &#39;IS to Marker&#39;
      respectively.&nbsp; They can be used to move to marked positions with image
      instead of stage shift.&nbsp; The same operation can be done with the 'IS to Nav
      Pt' button in this dialog.</p>
    <p>
      <i>1) Centering holes at a lower mag.</i>&nbsp; In order for image shift
      positions to correspond well enough between this mag and the record mag, this
      operation must be done near focus (within about 20 microns), unless there are 
      calibrations for both magnification and image shift at high defocus.&nbsp; The 
      message line below the buttons for recording image shifts will indicate whether 
      defocused image may work.&nbsp; Assuming that
      you use View images, the steps are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you do not have the high-defocus calibrations, reduce the View defocus offset to the lowest level that you need to see the
        holes.</li>
      <li>Take a View image.</li>
      <li>If image shift range is a concern, first shift the image with the right mouse
        button to center the pattern, and reset the image shift if necessary.</li>
      <li>Add a set of Navigator points at the centers of the holes, in the order
        required when shifting to the holes (see below).&nbsp; If necessary, take a new
        View image to see the required positions.</li>
      <li>Press the relevant button to start saving image shifts.</li>
      <li>Press the &#39;IS to Nav Pt&#39; button in this dialog, or select the first added point in the Navigator and press &#39;Go To IS&#39;
        there.</li>
      <li>Take a View image, center with the right mouse button, and take another to
        check the centering.</li>
      <li>When centered, press the &#39;Save Image Shift&#39; button.</li>
      <li>Press the &#39;IS to Nav Pt&#39; button in this dialog, or select the next added point in the Navigator and press &#39;Go To IS&#39;
        there.</li>
      <li>Take a View and center the image.</li>
      <li>Press &#39;Save Image Shift&#39;.</li>
      <li>Repeat the last three steps for each other point.</li>
      <li>Restore the View defocus offset.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This method can be accurate to within 1% on a scope with good correspondence
      between View and Record positions, but can be off by a lot.</p>
    <p>
      2)
      <i>Picking consistent positions at an intermediate mag where it is still easy to
      find the hole.</i>&nbsp; Even if you cannot
      use the View mag, you will probably get accurate positions at some mag closer to
      the Record mag (e.g., half the mag), because image shifts are likely to be
      consistent at higher mags.&nbsp; You will probably be able to use this method
      without changing the View defocus offset, but you will need to change the Record
      mag.&nbsp; The program will save the Record Low Dose parameters when you start
      recording positions and restore them when you stop, as long as you are still in
      Low Dose mode with the same camera selected. &nbsp;The steps are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Take a View image.</li>
      <li>If image shift range is a concern, first shift the image with the right mouse
        button to center the pattern, and reset the image shift if necessary.</li>
      <li>Add a set of Navigator points in the right order, either at the centers of the
        holes (if you think you can define those at the intermediate mag), or at an edge
        at +/-45 or +/-135 degrees.</li>
      <li>Press the relevant button to start saving image shifts.</li>
      <li>Press the &#39;IS to Nav Pt&#39; button in this dialog, or select the first added point in the Navigator and press &#39;Go To IS&#39;
        there.</li>
      <li>Press the &#39;Got to Record&#39; button in the Low Dose control panel to go to Record
        mode, turn on continuous update, and change the mag to the chosen value.</li>
      <li>Take a Record or Preview image and shift it to either center the hole or
        position the chosen quadrant of the edge.</li>
      <li>Press &#39;Save Image Shift&#39;.</li>
      <li>Press the &#39;IS to Nav Pt&#39; button in this dialog, or select the next added point in the Navigator and press &#39;Go To IS&#39;
        there.</li>
      <li>Take a Record or Preview and shift it to the same position as for the first
        point.</li>
      <li>Press &#39;Save Image Shift&#39;.</li>
      <li>Repeat the last three steps for each other point.</li>
      <li>The program will restore the Record parameters.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      3) <i>Picking consistent positions at the Record mag.</i>&nbsp; This method is
      guaranteed to give accurate image shift values, as long as you can define
      consistent positions.&nbsp; If you think that you can position edges well
      enough, then the procedure is the same as just described, except that you do not
      need to change the Record mag.&nbsp; However, if you have difficulty finding the
      holes, you may need to reduce the View defocus offset close to zero.&nbsp; This
      will likely throw off the View shift offset, and you might need to adjust that
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      An alternative to positioning edges is to take a Prescan montage at the Record
      mag big enough to show the whole hole, and center that.&nbsp; This may be
      reasonably fast, especially if you use continuous mode with a K2/K3 camera.&nbsp;
      The steps are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select File - New Montage.</li>
      <li>Turn off &#39;Use View in Low Dose mode&#39; and &#39;Use Search in Low Dose mode&#39;</li>
      <li>Select the number of pieces that will make an image bigger than a hole.</li>
      <li>For a K2/K3 camera, turn on the option to &#39;Use continuous mode&#39; and set the
        settling factor to at least 0.75.</li>
      <li>If necessary, adjust the exposure time of the Record parameters, or of the
        Mont-Map parameter set if you selected the option to use that.</li>
      <li>Follow all the steps in method 2 above through pressing the &#39;IS to Nav Pt&#39; button.</li>
      <li>Press &#39;Prescan&#39; in the Montage control panel.</li>
      <li>Shift the overview image in the buffer B to center the hole.&nbsp; Take
        another Prescan if necessary.</li>
      <li>Press &#39;Save Image Shift&#39;.</li>
      <li>Press the &#39;IS to Nav Pt&#39; button in this dialog, or select the next added point in the Navigator and press &#39;Go To IS&#39;
        there.</li>
      <li>Take a Prescan and center it.</li>
      <li>Press &#39;Save Image Shift&#39;.</li>
      <li>Repeat the last three steps for each other point.</li>
      <li>Restore any parameters that you changed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b><i>The Dialog Controls</i></b></p>
    <p><b>Do multiple Records within each hole</b></p>
    <p>Select this checkbox to take images in a circular pattern.&nbsp; The relevant controls will appear when it is selected.&nbsp;
      The property &#39;MultiInHoleStartAngle&#39; can be used to control the angles of the positions.&nbsp; 
      In the absnce of that property, if the specimen is
        tilted above 20 degrees, the first off-center
      shot will be done on the tilt axis, so that you can take
      up to three shots along the tilt axis in a hole.&nbsp; Otherwise, the first shot
        is taken along the camera X axis, or along the short axis of the camera for a
        non-square camera, which may allow two or three shots to fit along that axis
        when they would not along the long axis.</p>
    <p><b>Number of shots in main ring around center</b></p>
    <p>Select a value between 2 and 18 for the number of Records taken in off-center
      positions in the first or only ring of positions.</p>
    <p><b>Distance from center to main ring of shots</b></p>
    <p>Distance from the center position to the first or only ring of off-center positions, in microns.&nbsp;
      This distance must be at least as big as the beam diameter to avoid exposing
      overlapping areas in more than one Record shot.&nbsp; If the multi-shot circles
      are being displayed, press tab or Enter to have the image redrawn after entering
      a new distance.</p>
    <p><strong>Do second ring of shots</strong></p>
    <p>Select this checkbox to take Records in a second ring, which will be taken
      after the first ring but can be either inside or outside it.&nbsp; Use the
      spinner to select the number of shots in the second ring, and enter the distance
      from the center, in microns, in the edit box.</p>
    <p><b>Shot in center</b></p>
    <p>With these radio buttons, you can include a shot in the center of the pattern,
      which should be possible with 6 or more off-center shots.&nbsp; The centered
      shot can be taken either before or after the off-center shots.&nbsp; Although
      taking it may involve one more delay for image shift settling, it is reported
      that this shot will have less drift when taken after the others.</p>
    <p><b>Do Records in multiple holes</b></p>
    <p>Select this checkbox to take Records in either a rectangular or hexagonal grid of positions
      or a series of arbitrary, &#39;custom&#39; positions around the current center position.&nbsp;
      The relevant controls will appear when it is selected.</p>
    <p><b>Multiplier of usual delay after shifting to hole</b></p>
    <p>SerialEM has a built-in settling time after image shift that depends on the
      size of the shift; it is probably inadequate at high magnification.&nbsp; The
      factor entered here increases this settling time when shifting between holes;
      the extra delay time described below is still added to the settling time.&nbsp;
      This separate entry allows you to have an adequate settling time when moving
      between holes without having to make the extra delay for shots within a hole
      bigger than necessary.</p>
    <p><b>Regular pattern of holes: n by n</b></p>
    <p>Use the two spinners to set the number of positions in a rectangular pattern.&nbsp; 
      These values must be set before recording the image shift values at the corners. 
      Once the spacing of the pattern is defined, the spinners can be changed to 
      acquire more or fewer holes at that spacing.&nbsp; SerialEM will generally 
      acquire the number of positions specified by the current setting in the dialog 
      (or the last setting there when it was open).&nbsp; There are two important
      exceptions to this: 1) If Edit mode is turned on in the Navigator, then Shift-Left
      double-click with the mouse sufficiently close to one of the positions in the
      array around the current item will remove that position.&nbsp; After that, the
      size of the array becomes a permanent property of that item, and it will be both
      displayed and acquired as an array of that size (minus the removed position(s))
      regardless of changes in the selection in this dialog. 2) The
      <a href="hidd_multi_combiner.htm">Multi-hole Combiner</a> also makes the pattern 
      to use a permanent property of each item that it creates.</p>
    <p>The default is to acquire holes in a spiral order from the center outwards.&nbsp; 
      The menu entry <a href="menu_navigator.htm#hid_montaginggrids_setholeorderforregulararray">Set Hole Order for 
            Regular Array</a> can be used to have them taken in a zigzag or raster order 
    from one corner of the pattern.
    <p>If for some reason you are not using the Multi-hole combiner, you can do the 
      following to avoid having to remove many points from a large array when marking points at
      the edge of a grid square after filling the rest of the square: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Mark as many points as possible with the large pattern selected.</li>
      <li>Drop the pattern size down, say to 3 by 3 or to the 5-hole cross (see next).</li>
      <li>Mark additional points at the edge, being sure to remove at least one position
        from each to lock it into the current pattern, and making sure that no hole is
        covered twice (you may have to switch back to the main pattern temporarily to
        see this, with the option
        <a href="menu_navigator.htm#hid_montaginggrids_showwholeareaforallpoints">Show Whole
          Area for All Points</a> turned on).</li>
      <li>Reselect the original large array size so that the first set of marked points
        will acquire that pattern.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Hex grid</strong></p>
    <p>Select this option if the grid holes are in a hexagonal pattern.&nbsp; The 
      first spinner now sets the number of hexagonal rings to acquire around the 
      center point and the second spinner disappears.</p>
    <p><strong>Omit corners of 3 by 3 array (cross pattern)</strong></p>
    <p>This option allows one to acquire a cross-shaped pattern of 5 holes, which will
      involve less image shift than a full 3 by 3 array while still allowing one to
      center the marked point on a hole instead of between holes.&nbsp; It may also be
      useful when marking holes at the edge of a grid square after filling the rest of
      the square with a larger pattern, as long as one removes at least one position
      from the cross pattern.</p>
    <p><b>Use custom pattern</b></p>
    <p>Select this checkbox to take images in an arbitrary set of positions specified
      by shifting to a center location, which is not acquired, then to each acquisition
      position.&nbsp; A custom pattern can be used when you want to acquire at
      positions that are not regularly and symmetrically arranged around the marked Navigator point.
    </p>
    <p><b>Save Image Shift Values at Holes</b></p>
    <p>Press <strong>For Corners of Regular Pattern</strong> to start setting the image shifts needed
      for a regular pattern, or <strong>For Custom Pattern</strong> to start setting the shifts for
      arbitrary positions.&nbsp; Press <B>Step To and Adjust IS</B> to visit the corners of a regular pattern, or all of the positions in a custom pattern, and adjust the image shift there, and save the new shifts.  
      In the latter case, when in Low Dose mode, the
      <a href="hidd_step_and_adjust_is.htm">Step and Adjust IS Setup</a> dialog will 
      open to allow you to set the conditions for imaging.&nbsp; After pressing one of these buttons, the label below
      the third line of buttons will summarize what to do next.</p>
    <p>To set the corners of a regular rectangular pattern, you will save to image shifts at 4 hole
      positions, even if one of the spinners is set to 1.&nbsp; Start at one corner of
      the pattern and save the position.&nbsp; Then shift by the needed number of
      holes corresponding to the value of the first spinner (i.e., move by 2 holes if
      the value is 3) and save that position.&nbsp; Shift by the number of holes
      indicated by the second spinner, save, and shift back by the number of holes
      along the first axis.&nbsp; If one of the spinners is set to 1, the program will
      still expect you to shift by one hole along that axis.</p>
    <p>To set the corners for a hexagonal pattern, you must shift to each of the 6 
      holes in the ring specified by the spinner.</p>
    <p>To set the positions in a custom pattern, shift to a center position for the 
      pattern and save the shift.&nbsp; When taking multiple Records, this position 
      will not be acquired at, but all the shifts will be done relative to it.&nbsp; 
      Then shift to the first point to be acquired and save that position.&nbsp; 
      Repeat until the last point and press <strong>End Pattern</strong>.</p>
    <p> When adjusting existing image shift values, new image shifts are recorded at 
      the same sequence of positions as when first saving them.&nbsp; You should start 
      out positioned on the center of the pattern.&nbsp; If a regular pattern is selected 
      (i.e., if <strong>Use custom pattern </strong>is not checked), press <b>Step To and Adjust 
      IS</b>, select the Low Dose area and magnification in the
      <a href="hidd_step_and_adjust_is.htm">Step and Adjust IS Setup</a> dialog if in 
      Low Dose mode, and the image shift will be set to reach the first corner of the pattern.&nbsp; Press
       <b>Save Image Shift</b> after adjusting the image shift (or not), and it will move on to the next position, 
      eventually going to all four corners (or 6 corners for a hexagonal array).&nbsp; 
      If a custom pattern is selected, press <b>Step To and Adjust 
      IS</b>, then adjust the centering on the origin of the pattern if necessary.&nbsp; Press <b>Save Image Shift</b> 
      to store that reference location, and it will move to the first position to be 
      recorded.&nbsp; Continue through the rest of the positions to be recorded.&nbsp; 
      When adjusting image shift outside of Low Dose mode, the magnification will be set to that at which image shifts were 
      previously defined.&nbsp; 
      However, you are free to change the magnification at which you adjust the 
      shifts.</p>
    <p> In most cases, an adjusting transformation will be saved when you complete the <b>Step To and Adjust 
      IS</b> procedure for a regular rectangular or hexagonal array, along with the 
      magnifications at which the pattern was originally defined and at which the 
      positions were adjusted.&nbsp; If vectors are defined again at the same 
      magnification, this transformation can be applied with the <strong>Apply 
      Adjustment </strong>button or the 
      &#39;AdjustMultiShotPattern&#39; script command.&nbsp; Specifically, if vectors from a 
      hole-finding operation are used to define image shift vectors, and you then 
      adjust those vectors to be accurate at higher magnification with this procedure, 
      a new set of hole vectors can be adjusted in the same way with that command.&nbsp; 
      If you apply the adjusting transform to a pattern and then use the <b>Step To and Adjust 
      IS</b> procedure and adjust positions at the same magnification as previously, 
      the adjusting transformation will be modified by the changes in position.&nbsp; 
      In this way, an adjusting transformation from a previous session should be a 
      good starting point and can then be refined to apply to the current session.&nbsp; 
      In addition, the adjusting transform can be refined in two stages.&nbsp; After 
      defining the pattern and using <b>Step To and Adjust 
      IS</b> to adjust at an intermediate magnification, you can simply press <b>Step To and Adjust 
      IS</b> again and adjust the shifts at a higher magnification.&nbsp; When that 
      adjustment is finished, the product of adjusting transformations is saved and 
      will be available to transform all the way from the original magnification to 
      the high one.&nbsp; 
      An adjusting transformation is not saved if the pattern was created with 
      &#39;SetCustomHoleShifts&#39; or &#39;SetRegularHoleVectors&#39;, modified with 
      &#39;RotateMultiShotPattern&#39;, or created from hole-finding vectors with 
      &#39;UseHoleVectorsForMulti #&#39; and <strong>#</strong> greater than -2, the value that 
      makes it use the magnification of the image on which holes were found.</p>
    <p> See above for instructions on how to save sufficiently accurate shift values 
      with these methods.</p>
      <p><b>IS to Nav Pt</b></p>
    <p>Press this button to move to the location of the current Navigator point
      with image shift and then select the next point&nbsp; in the table.&nbsp; This saves you from
      pressing &#39;IS to XY&#39; and selecting the next point in the Navigator window, extra
      steps where you can lose track of whether you have changed the selection there.&nbsp;
      Press this button on first starting the saving operation and immediately after
      each &#39;Save Image Shift&#39;.&nbsp; The first time that you do so, the program looks
      at how many points are in the current group and which one is selected.&nbsp; If
      the first one is selected, or if you are defining a regular pattern and there
      are 4 points, it will image shift to the first point in the group and select the
      next one.&nbsp; Otherwise, it will ask you if you want to start from the
      beginning and work forward, or start at the end and work backward (which is not
      going to work for a custom group unless you marked the central point at the
      end), or simply leave the selected point alone.</p>
    <p><b>Save Image Shift&nbsp; </b> </p>
    <p>Press this button to save the current image shift at the next corner in a
      regular pattern, or the next spot in a custom pattern.</p>
    <p><b>End Pattern</b></p>
    <p>Press this button to end the entries when defining a custom pattern.&nbsp; It
      can be pressed either after saving the last position, or without explicitly
      saving it.&nbsp; The current image shift will be saved if it is different from
      that of the last saved point.</p>
    <p><b>Abort</b></p>
    <p>Press this button to stop entering or adjusting shifts and throw away all entries.</p>
    <p>&#39;Use:&#39;<strong> Last Hole Vectors</strong></p>
    <p>Press this button to convert the vectors from the last hole-finding operation 
      to image shift values for a regular pattern.&nbsp; This operation is equivalent 
      to using the &#39;UseHoleVectorsForMulti&#39; script command.&nbsp; The program will ask 
      if you are sure you want to replace the current image shift values, in case the 
      button was pressed accidentally.&nbsp; You can press &#39;Yes Always&#39; to avoid that 
      confirmation for this session of the program.&nbsp; You must be in Low Dose mode for the button to be enabled.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>'Use:' <strong>Map Hole Vectors</strong></p>
    <p>Press this button to assign the shifts for a regular pattern from the image 
      shift vectors stored in a map when the Hole Finder was run on it.&nbsp; The 
      current Navigator item must be either such a map or an item drawn on such a map.&nbsp; 
      This operation is equivalent to using the &#39;UseMapItemHoleVectors&#39; command.&nbsp; 
      Just like for <strong>Use Last Hole Vectors</strong>, you will be asked to 
      confirm that you want to use the shift vectors.</p>
    <p>'Use:' <strong>Nav Pts</strong></p>
    <p>Press this button to convert the group of Navigator&nbsp;items to which the 
      currently selected item belongs into image shift vectors.&nbsp; The button will 
      be enabled only when preconditions are met.&nbsp; Specifically, the Navigator 
      must be open and there must be 4 points in the current group if a regular 
      rectangular array is selected, 6 points if a hexagonal array is selected, or 
      more than one point if a custom pattern is selected.&nbsp; As a special case, 
      when no custom pattern has been defined yet, the program will let you use this 
      button and ask whether you want to define a custom pattern when there are not 4 
      points (if <strong>Hex grid</strong> is not selected) or 6 points (if <strong>Hex grid</strong> is selected) in the group. </p>
    <p><strong>Step To and Adjust</strong></p>
    <p>Press this button to step to each of the positions of a defined pattern and 
      adjust the image shift there.&nbsp; See detailed instructions above.</p>
    <p><strong>Apply Adjustment (and adjustment status line)</strong></p>
    <p>Press this button to apply the adjustment stored when <strong>Step To and 
      Adjust</strong> was last used to the current image shift values (which can be 
      regular vectors or customs shifts).&nbsp; The magnification at which the current 
      shifts were defined must match either the original or current magnification of the shifts that were adjusted in that 
      procedure.&nbsp; The button will be disabled when the operation is not possible, 
      and the status line below the button will indicate the reason that it is 
      disabled.&nbsp; See instructions above.</p>
    <p>When shifts have been adjusted, the beam circles in the display will be yellow 
      instead of green.&nbsp; This color is an indicator not only that shifts have 
      been adjusted, but also that you should expect the positions not to be on the 
      holes in the original map, since they have been modified from the positions that <em>are</em> on the holes.</p>
    <p><b>Save Record image</b></p>
    <p>Select this option to have the Record image saved in the current file.&nbsp;
      The option is disabled and its setting is irrelevant if an early return is
      selected for all Records with no returned image.&nbsp; However, if any images
      are returned, they will all be saved as of SerialEM 4.0.</p>
    <p><b>Early returns for K2/K3</b></p>
    <p>This group of controls appears when there is a K2 or K3 camera available and
        allows for SerialEM to resume operations as soon as possible after acquiring an
        image with saved frames, the same as is accomplished with the script command
        &#39;EarlyReturnNextShot&#39;.&nbsp; The radio buttons allow you to select to have an
        early return only on the last shot, on all shots, or on all shots except the
        first one.&nbsp; The latter option allows you to assess quality (e.g., from an
        FFT or&nbsp;from frame alignment results) on the first shot without having it
        quickly replaced by another. If post-exposure
      actions are enabled for the camera (namely, if <A HREF="menu_camera.htm#hid_camera_postactions">Post-actions</A>
      in the Camera menu is not grayed out and is selected), then image shift to the
      next position will occur soon after the exposure is finished for each shot,
      regardless of whether early return is selected, and it is slightly more
      efficient not to do an early return except on the last shot.&nbsp; If
      post-actions are not enabled, the early return will allow the program to do the
      image shift sooner.</p>
    <p>In the text box in this group, enter the number of frames in the returned
      image: 0 for none, a specific number of frames, or -1 for all the frames.</p>
      <p>If frame alignment in the SerialEMCCD plugin is selected in the Record
          parameters, this alignment will be done only for shots without an early return;
          i.e., the deferred aligned sum computed when using alignment in the plugin with
          &#39;EarlyReturnNextShot&#39; is not done here.</p>
    <p><b>Extra delay after image shift</b></p>
    <p>A standard amount of settling time is imposed after each image shift; the extra
      delay entered here will be added to this settling time.</p>
    <p><b>Adjust beam tilt &amp; astig to compensate for image shift</b></p>
    <p>This option is enabled if you have calibrated the beam tilt needed for
      coma-free alignment as a function of image shift with
      <a href="menu_focus.htm#hid_focustuning_comavs">Coma vs. Image Shift</a>
      in the Calibration - Focus &amp; Tuning submenu.&nbsp; If so, then beam tilt will be
      adjusted appropriately for each Record position, and restored at the end.&nbsp;
      As of SerialEM 3.8, the dependence of astigmatism on image shift is
      also calibrated and will be compensated, unless the property
      &#39;SkipAstigAdjustmentForIS&#39; is set.
      In addition, the image shift present when starting the routine will also be
      compensated for, unless the script command &#39;AdjustBeamTiltforIS&#39; was run or beam
      tilt was adjusted by any of the image-shift setting commands that provide the
      adjustment.&nbsp; The conditions under which the calibration was taken are shown on the following
      line.&nbsp; For the adjustment to work accurately, the current beam intensity at
      least should be close to what it was when the calibration was done.</p>
    <p><strong>Calibrate Coma vs. IS</strong></p>
    <p>Pressing this button will open the <a href="hidd_coma_vs_is_cal.htm">Coma vs. 
      Image Shift Calibration dialog</a> and allow you to calibrate the beam tilt 
      adjustments needed to compensate for image shift.&nbsp; Note that the maximum 
      image shift needed for a regular pattern of holes is shown in the summary line 
      below the spinners that select the size of the pattern.</p>
    <p><strong>Test Multishot Positions</strong></p>
    <p>Pressing this button will start a test of the beam tilt adjustment needed at 
      various positions, either with or without adjustment for image shift depending 
      on whether <b>Adjust beam tilt &amp; astig to compensate for image shift </b>is 
      checked.&nbsp; See details in <a HREF="#testing"></a><i><b>Testing Image Location and Coma Adjustment</b></i> 
      below.</p>
    <p><b>Diameter of circles to draw</b></p>
    <p>If the multi-shot circles are being displayed, the diameter of the circles is
      set to the entered value in microns, unless the option described next is
      selected to use the illuminated area on a Thermo/FEI Titan.&nbsp; Press tab or Enter
      to have the image redrawn after entering a new diameter.</p>
    <p><b>Use Record illuminated area for circles in Low Dose</b></p>
    <p>This option appears on a Thermo/FEI Titan and allows the multi-shot circle display to
      take its diameter from the illuminated area setting of the Record area when Low
      Dose mode is on instead of from the value entered in this dialog.&nbsp; The
      display will be updated dynamically as this illuminated area setting is changed.&nbsp;
      This update works even while this dialog is option, provided that the scope is
      in the Record area and &#39;Continuous update&#39; is check in the Low Dose Control
      panel before opening the dialog, and illuminated area is changed with microscope
      controls.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>For this option to be valuable rather than misleading, the illuminated area
      readout must be fairly accurate in the range of interest, which may not be the
      case.</p>
    <p><a NAME="testing"></a><i><b>Testing Image Location and Coma Adjustment</b></i></p>
    <p>Once positions are set up in this dialog, the script command 'TestNextMultiShot 
      1' followed by 'MultipleRecords' can be used to test whether image positions are 
      suitable. &#39;TestNextMultiShot 2&#39; or the <strong>Test Multishot Positions</strong> 
      button can be used to measure the amount of beam
      tilt adjustment needed at various positions, either with or without an
      adjustment for image shift, depending on the state of the <b>Adjust beam tilt &amp; astig to compensate for image shift </b>
      checkbox.&nbsp; The details of this operation are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If shots are being taken only within a hole, then test images will be taken
        only at each peripheral position, while beam tilt will be measured first in the
        central position then at all peripheral positions.</li>
      <li>If shots are being taken in multiple holes, images or beam tilt measurements
        will be taken in the centers of holes only.</li>
      <li>When a regular hole pattern is selected, the four corners of the pattern, or
        two ends of a single line of holes, will be tested.</li>
      <li>When a custom pattern is selected, all holes in the pattern will be tested.</li>
      <li>Record images will be taken when testing images within a hole, or when testing
        multiple holes if the current open file is not a montage.&nbsp; Most likely,
        montages will be needed to test holes.</li>
      <li>Record images will be saved only if the option to save them is checked;
        otherwise they will accumulate in the rolling buffers.&nbsp; In the latter case,
        be sure to allow enough buffers to see all the images afterwards.</li>
      <li>To test with montages, open a new montage file with enough pieces to cover
        the hole; it must not be in View mode or be done with stage shift.</li>
      <li>After saving montages or Record images, use the menu entry File - Read and use
        the buttons in the dialog to inspect the images.</li>
    </ul>
