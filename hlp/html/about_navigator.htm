    <P>The Navigator window and its associated menu entries provide the capability to 
      save stage positions and return to them, to make and save maps of areas of 
      interest, mark positions on these maps and go to the marked positions, 
      accurately return to positions on maps, and transform positions after moving 
      the grid in the specimen holder. This section explains some of the concepts 
      involved in using the Navigator.</P>

    <P><A NAME="nav_items"></A><B>Navigator Items</B></P>
    <P>The Navigator maintains a list of items which are 
      shown in a box. It considers items to be of three types: points, polygons, and 
      maps. A point is a single location, which will be displayed with a colored 
      cross on images that contain the point. A polygon is set of connected points 
      enclosing a region, which will be displayed as a set of lines forming a closed 
      contour. A map is an image that has been saved to a file; the Navigator keeps 
      track of where the image was saved as well as the stage position of the image 
      and the conditions under which the image was acquired. The location of a map is 
      displayed as a rectangle on other images. The Navigator makes it easy to reload 
      a selected map image, regardless of whether all of your maps are in one file or 
      separate files, and of whether the files are open or not. Maps can be either 
      single frame or montaged images.</P>
    <P>Points can be added in two different ways. You can move the stage to a specific 
      location and then press a button ('Add Stage Pos') to add the location as a 
      point. Alternatively, once you have taken a low-mag image at a known stage 
      location, you can press a button ('Add Points') to start adding points, then 
      click the left mouse button at a series of locations in the image. Each 
      location becomes a new point item with a separate stage position deduced from 
      its location in the image. A polygon can be generated in a similar fashion, by 
      pressing 'Add Polygon' and clicking points on an image.</P>
    <P><A NAME="maps"></A><B>Maps</B></P>
    <P>A map can be created from an acquired image simply by pushing a button after saving it to a file, 
      or even before saving it if the image is compatible with the current open file. A montaged 
      image can be made into a map as long as the montage overview is still in buffer 
      B. There is also a feature for automatically acquiring a series of maps at 
      selected points. Again, these maps can be either single frame images or 
      montages. They will all be saved into a single file that must be set up before 
      starting the automatic acquisition.</P>
    <P>The large-area images used for maps are usually generated by taking montages 
      with stage movements between the frames. The Navigator menu provides three ways 
      to define the area that will be acquired in a montage. One option is simply to 
      define an area that will capture the entire grid ('Setup Full Montage'). 
      Another option is to move the stage to a series of points at the corners of the 
      region of interest, such as the corners of the first and last sections of a 
      ribbon. When each of these points is marked as a 'corner' point, the 'Setup 
      Corner Montage' menu entry will set up a montage to encompass all of the area 
      bounded by these points. The third option is to draw a polygon; the 'Setup 
      Polygon Montage' menu entry will set up a montage to capture the area 
      delineated by the polygon. When you select one of these options, the Montage 
      Setup dialog will open in a special mode in which it will adjust the number of 
      frames to fit the selected area whenever you change the magnification or the 
      overlap between adjacent montage frames. Note that in all of these cases, a 
      full rectangular array of frames need not be acquired; the program will omit 
      pieces that fall outside of the defined area.&nbsp; After a montage has been set 
      up to acquire inside a polygon, it can be used for acquiring the same shape of 
      area in multiple locations without drawing a polygon at those locations, as long 
      as they are acquired as additional sections in the same file.</P>
    <P><A NAME="groups"></A><B>Groups of Items</B></P>
    <P>When points are added in a single operation, they are 
      defined as belonging to a group. A group is created when you add a series of 
      points by clicking in an image, add a grid of points with a menu command, or 
      define a set of positions for 'supermontaging' (acquiring a set of overlapping 
      montages). The dialog box has an option for collapsing the listing of group 
      items into a single line summarizing those items; this can help when there are 
      many points in a group. Several commands operate on all the items in a group.</P>
    <P><A NAME="realign"></A><B>Returning to a Position Reliably</B></P>
    <P>The Navigator incorporates several features to help you get to a desired 
      location despite the imperfections of the microscope. Image misalignments 
      between the magnifications can become quite large at very low magnification. 
      These misalignments limit the ability to mark a feature in an image at one 
      magnification and go to that feature at a much higher magnification. If the 
      image shifts needed to compensate for the misalignments have been calibrated, 
      you can choose to have these image shifts applied so that features stay centered 
      when you change magnification. Even if you do not turn on this option, the 
      Navigator will use these image shifts to adjust stage positions appropriately 
      for the particular magnification. With these adjustments, if you mark a feature 
      in an image taken at, say 200x, and then go to that position while at a 
      magnification like 3000x, you should be able to find the feature in an image 
      taken at that magnification. In contrast, if you go to the position while still 
      at 200x, the stage will be moved to the appropriate position for centering the 
      feature at 200x, and it may not appear at the higher magnification. Note also 
      that these adjustments are of limited accuracy and will generally not be adequate for keeping a feature in the 
      field of view across a 100-fold range of magnification.
    </P>
    <P>A second problem with returning to a marked position is that the actual stage 
      position at which a feature is centered may change by a few microns over time, 
      possibly due to drift, shrinkage, or accumulation of errors from extensive 
      stage movements. There are two features that help deal with this problem. One 
      is the ability to shift the stage positions of all of the items by the same 
      amount. This can be done by adding a point at a defined feature in an existing 
      map, then taking a current image that shows the feature and clicking on the 
      feature there. The 'Shift to Marker' menu entry is then used to shift the 
      points. After this, you should be able to click on any point in that map and go 
      to the point, without the error that was just eliminated by the shift. However, 
      a different shift correction may be needed for distant points.
    </P>
    <P>The second feature that helps in returning to a marked position is a routine for 
      'realigning' to a position by correlation with an existing map taken in regular 
      mag mode. In order to return reliably to a position, it must be located in a 
      map that is at least as big as the maximum possible stage error, and preferably 
      twice as large. Thus, points to be realigned to should probably be located in a 
      map at least 10 microns in extent. They can be near the edge of such a map, 
      since it is the overall size of the map and not the distance of the point from 
      the edge that matters. Do not expect reliable realignment to a point in a map 
      that is only 2 microns in extent.</P>
    <P>If you wish to realign precisely to a high-magnification image, such as for 
      doing a tilt series, then you will need two maps: the medium-mag map for 
      reliably returning to the vicinity of the point, and a high-mag image stored as 
      a map. Three approaches to doing this are described next, along with their 
      abilities to deal with the three problems that limit the reliability of realign 
      routine.&nbsp; These problems are referred to as: &quot;intrinsic error in returning 
      to the position&quot;, which was described above; &quot;mags not well-aligned&quot;, which 
      means that there is a misalignment between the medium and high mags and that 
      there is either no image shift offset calibration or an inaccurate one; and 
      &quot;backlash&quot;, which refers to the extent that the stage does not return to the 
      same position when it is approached from a different direction from the original 
      one.&nbsp; Note that if you take the medium-mag map in Low Dose mode with View 
      images (single frame or montage), it is possible to correct a misalignment 
      between the mags with a View shift offset (see <b>Shift offset for View</b> in
      <a href="hidd_lowdose.htm">Low Dose</a>).&nbsp; </P>
    <ol>
      <li><i><b>Anchor maps.</b></i>&nbsp; The simplest method is just to take two 
      map images at every desired location, the high-mag image and one at, say, 3000x. 
      The latter map is referred to as an 'anchor map'. You can store these in the 
      same file or different files. After you have stored one map at the medium mag, 
      you can mark this as a map to be used as a template for making more anchor maps. 
      Thereafter, you can create a new anchor map with a single button press.&nbsp; The 
        specific steps to follow are:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Find the first desired location.&nbsp; Acquire and save a high-mag image 
        and make it a map with the <b>New Map</b> button.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Go to the medium mag suitable for realigning, acquire and save an image, 
        and make it a map.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Turn on the <b>For anchor state</b> checkbox.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Find the next desired location.&nbsp; At the high mag, take an image, 
        shift with the right mouse button to show the desired area, and take a new 
        image.&nbsp; Press the <b>Anchor Map</b> button.&nbsp; The current image will be 
        saved as a map and the program will acquire and save the anchor map too.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Repeat step (d) at&nbsp; other locations.<br />
        This method works well even if the mags are not well-aligned, and backlash will 
        not contribute to errors in returning to the position if you allow the program 
        to adjust for backlash when it takes the anchor map (or use a montage for the 
        anchor map).&nbsp; The method is most suitable when you do not already have a 
        medium-mag map.</li>
      <li><b><i>Mark points and use Acquire at Points to get high-mag maps.</i></b>&nbsp; 
        This approach takes advantage of an existing montaged map covering a 
      larger area. Add one or more points on one or more medium-mag maps and select 
        &#39;Acquire&#39; for each one.&nbsp; Run the 'Acquire at Points' menu item to acquire 
        at map at each point and specify 'Realign to item' as an initial action.&nbsp; 
        This method will give robust return to this position and realignment to the 
        high-mag map, but it is suitable only if the mags are well enough aligned so 
        that the desired area is adequately centered in the high-mag map.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;<b><i>Move to positions marked in medium-mag maps, adjust positions and 
        take maps at high mag.</i></b>&nbsp; In its simplest form, namely by clicking in 
        the map, using <b>Go To Marker</b>, then moving around at high mag to center the 
        area of interest, this method is vulnerable both in the initial repositioning to 
        the medium-mag map and in the alignment to the high-mag map.&nbsp; The initial 
        repositioning is impaired to the extent there are already errors in returning to 
        the medium-mag map position, which could be the case if numerous maps were taken 
        before marking points on this one.&nbsp; The alignment to the high-mag map could 
        fail if the mags are misaligned by more than 1/3 of the extent of the high-mag 
        map.&nbsp; There are two ways to make this approach more reliable:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Acquire a single image anchor map for each high-mag map: i.e., use 
        method 1 above.&nbsp; This eliminates the effects of pre-existing positioning 
        errors and of misaligned mags.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Add a point instead of just clicking at the desired location.&nbsp; <i>
        Be sure to be at the higher mag</i>, and press <b>Realign to Item</b>. Then 
        center on the desired location <i>using image shift only, not stage shift</i>.&nbsp; 
        Take an image and make it a map.&nbsp; The errors found in realigning to the 
        nearby point will be recorded for this map and taken into account when 
        realigning again; backlash will also not be a problem.&nbsp; Realignment to the 
        high-mag map could still fail if the mags are misaligned too much.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The lessons from above are that methods relying an existing montaged map work 
      best if the mags are well aligned, either intrinsically or with an accurate 
      image offset calibration, and that using an Anchor map should give the most 
      reliable repositioning.</p>
    <P>On FEI microscopes, if a medium-magnification montaged map is taken with stage 
      movement, there are some advantages in taking the montage with the option to 
      &#39;Realign with image shift&#39; (available when the option &#39;Use settings for 
      high-quality stage montage&#39; is selected).&nbsp; Because of periodic, systematic 
      errors in Compustage movement, stage montages with piece sizes around 5-10 
      microns may require overlaps of 20-25% to achieve sufficient overlap.&nbsp; 
      Using &#39;Realign with image shift&#39; will allow the montage to be taken with an 
      overlap of only 10%, provided that there are sufficient image features present 
      for the this realignment to work.&nbsp; The more important advantage for mapping 
      is that when the Navigator moves to a point marked on a map acquired this way, 
      it can adjust by the errors in stage position found during montaging.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The &#39;Realign to item&#39; routine also takes account of the stage errors 
      appropriately.&nbsp; Taking montages with image shift realignment is 
      particularly recommended for maps to be used for setting up supermontages. </P>
    <P><A NAME="states"></A><B>Imaging States</B></P>
    <P>The Imaging State dialog allows you to store and 
      set the microscope state and Record acquisition parameters, thus making it 
      easier to acquire images at different magnifications. Since this is 
      particularly helpful when making the different kinds of Navigator maps, the 
      dialog will generally open along with the Navigator. The dialog also allows you 
      to set a state for acquiring another map into the same file as an existing map.</P>
    <P><A NAME="registrations"></A><B>Registrations</B></P>
    <P>The final concept that needs explaining is 
      'registration'. A registration is essentially one position of the grid in the 
      specimen holder, or one relationship between positions on the grid and stage 
      coordinates. Every item in the Navigator's list, as well as every image that 
      you take, is associated with a registration. When you first start using the 
      Navigator, all of the items that you add to the list are assumed to be at the 
      first registration. If you disturb the grid in the holder (or even if you 
      remove and replace the holder), you have changed the correspondence between 
      positions on the grid and stage coordinates. You should then indicate to 
      Navigator that the registration has changed by increasing the current 
      registration number. At this point, items from previous registrations will no 
      longer appear on newly acquired images (unless you select an option to make 
      them appear) because they would not be in the right place. To get them into the 
      right place and make them useful again, you need to transform them to the new 
      registration.</P>
    <P>To transform items to a new registration, you must first define some of the 
      Navigator points at the first registration as registration points. You do this 
      by selecting the 'Registration point' checkbox and, if necessary, specifying a 
      point number as well for each of the relevant points. (Registration point 
      numbers will increment automatically.) After you have gone to a new 
      registration, you then move the stage to the same positions, add a new 
      Navigator point at each, and identify each point as a registration point with 
      the same number as in the first registration. Once you have identified a set of 
      corresponding points in this way, select a menu entry to transform the items 
      from the first registration to the new one. The program will find a 
      transformation whose complexity depends on the number of registration points 
      available. Just a shift will be found with 1 point, a rotation and shift with 2 
      points, rotation, scaling, and shift with 3 or 4 points, or a full linear 
      transformation including stretching with 5 points. All items except the 
      registration points will then be transformed and associated with the new 
      registration. (The registration points are left behind to allow the data to be 
      transformed back if necessary.) If you just need to adjust by a shift after 
      removing and replacing the holder or after moving the stage around a lot, you 
      can use just one registration point, or use the 'Shift to Marker' approach 
      described above.</P>
    <P><A NAME="mapping_steps"></A><B>A Step-by-Step  Procedure for Mapping</B></P>
    <P>A suggested procedure for 
      using the Navigator for mapping would be:</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        Go to a magnification that can be used to map the area of interest in a 
        reasonable number of large pixels, on the order of 10K x 10K (e.g., 10 by 10 
        pieces, each 1K x 1K). This might be as low as 160x.</LI>
      <LI>
        Move the stage to the corners of the area of interest and add the stage 
        position as a point at each corner. Define each point as a corner point, then 
        select 'Setup Corner Montage'. Alternatively, especially for cryomicroscopy, 
        select 'Setup Full Montage'.</LI>
      <LI>
        Acquire the montage and designate it as a map.</LI>
      <LI>
        On the montage overview, add a point at each location of interest (e.g., 
        corresponding location on serial sections, or grid squares with ice of the 
        right thickness.) Select 'Acquire' for each point to set it up for automatic 
        acquisition.</LI>
      <LI>
        At one of the locations of interest, draw a polygon around the area desired for 
        a medium-mag map. Go to an intermediate mag (like 3000x) so that a map of this 
        area will be a reasonable number of pixels. Select 'Setup Polygon Montage' to 
        define a montage area.</LI>
      <LI>
        Acquire a montage to check the area.</LI>
      <LI>
        If necessary, shift the registration. Add a point on an identifiable feature on 
        the low-mag map. Mark the same position on the new image with the left mouse 
        button. Select 'Shift to Marker'.</LI>
      <LI>
        Select 'Acquire Areas' to acquire all of the areas automatically. Go do 
        something else; these maps may take about 5 minutes each.</LI>
      <LI>
        When you load an individual map after it has been acquired, you can simply 
        click in the map then press 'Go To Marker' to move the stage to the selected 
        location. For more accurate positioning, go to the mag at which you want to 
        view a feature, add a point item on the map, and use 'Realign to Item'. You 
        could then acquire a tilt series at high mag.</LI>
      <LI>
        You do not need to close the montage file, but be sure to open a new file 
        before trying to start a tilt series.</LI></OL>
    <P><A NAME="rotation"></A>It is also possible to capture a series of intermediate 
      mag maps or montages into a separate file for each.&nbsp; The procedure would be 
      slightly different for steps 4 and 5:</P>
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. At one of the locations of interest, draw a polygon 
      around the area desired for a medium-mag map and select &#39;Acquire&#39;. Go to the 
      intermediate mag and select &#39;New file at item&#39;.&nbsp; In the little dialog that 
      comes up, select to make a montage and fit it to the polygon.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Mark all of the other desired locations with a series of points.&nbsp; 
      For each one, turn on &#39;Acquire&#39;, then select &#39;New file at item&#39;.&nbsp; Each new 
      file will inherit the properties of the polygon montage.</P>
    <P>If you need to have a different polygon at each location, such as when 
      capturing from a curving ribbon of sections, then this will require a different 
      montage file for each location.&nbsp; At each location, draw a polygon, select 
      &#39;Acquire&#39;&nbsp; then &#39;New file at item&#39;, and then go through the sequence for 
      fitting a polygon to the montage.</P>
    <P><B>Finding Points after Grid Rotation</B></P>
    <P>If you want to find 
      corresponding points after rotating a grid by 90 degrees, you could use the 
      following procedure:</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        Move the stage to five or six well-defined points (e.g., the corners of a 
        section of interest), add the stage position as a Navigator point, and make 
        each one a registration point.</LI>
      <LI>
        Add a point or map(s) at each location of interest (i.e., each place where a 
        tilt series is taken.)</LI>
      <LI>
        Rotate the grid.</LI>
      <LI>
        Increase the current registration number to 2.</LI>
      <LI>
        Find the five or six registration points and add each one as a registration 
        point in registration 2, making sure that the registration point numbers 
        correspond to the first registration.</LI>
      <LI>
        Select 'Transform Items' in the Navigator menu.</LI>
      <LI>
        Select one of the points of interest in the Navigator list box and press 'Go To 
        XY'. You should be close to the desired point. Errors of 5-10 microns are 
        likely if you localized the registration points in low mag mode; but the error 
        should be much less if you localized them at higher mag.</LI>
      <LI>
        If you saved medium-mag maps at any locations, you can use 'Realign to Item' to 
        return to and align to those locations. The program will rotate the map image 
        in order to align to it. You will probably need larger maps, 15-20 &micro;m in 
        extent, to realign reliably after a rotation.</LI></OL>
    <P>This procedure is tedious because of the need for so many registration points. 
      The number of points can be reduced to 3 or even 2 if the stretch in the stage 
      coordinate system has been calibrated. It is calibrated simply using a 
      transformation obtained from 6-8 registration points as just described, as long 
      as the points fit with moderately low error (see <A HREF="menu_calibration.htm#hid_calibration_stagestretch">
        Stage Stretch</A>).</P>
    <P>If you use the <A HREF="hidd_navrotalign.htm">Align with Rotation dialog</A> to 
      align to points after rotation, you could use the following procedure to get a 
      preliminary transformation with that dialog and replace it with one based on 
      registration points:</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        Make sure that you have medium mag maps at least 15-20 &micro;m in extent at two or 
        more locations separated by more than half of the extent of the area being 
        studied.

    <P><A NAME="overviewAlign"></A><B>A Counter-intuitive Point about Misaligned Montage Frames</B></P>
    <P>SerialEM will sometimes fail to align all of the montage frames in the
    overview image properly, particularly when there are grid bars over the
    zones of overlap between adjacent pieces. It is important to realize that such
    a misalignment generally does not affect the accuracy with which a map can
    be used. A position marked on a montage map is converted to a stage
    coordinate by determining which frame the position is in and the pixel
    coordinate within that frame, and then deriving a stage coordinate solely
    from this pixel position and the stage coordinates at which that frame was
    acquired. The marked coordinate will thus not depend on whether the
    pieces in the overview are properly aligned, misaligned, or not aligned at
    all. (You can demonstrate this by adding a point at the same position on
    a map after reloading it with and without piece alignment turned on - the
    coordinates that appear in the Navigator table will be the same.)  The
    accuracy of both moving to marked positions and using the Realign to
      Item routine at them should not depend on whether a map is well-aligned.
    Two actions do require a well-aligned map: adding a grid of points over a
    set of holes, and setting up an array of supermontage positions. 
    </P>
    <P><A NAME="memory"></A><B>Memory Considerations</B></P>
    <P>Large maps are memory intensive. If you keep 
      many of them around by copying them to other buffers, you can easily run out of 
      memory and start using swap file space. You should generally use binning to make 
      them more information-dense, but the amount of binning depends on the kind of 
      camera, the size of pixels in the detector, and the voltage.&nbsp; The most 
      binning is needed for CCD cameras at 200 and 300 KV, which should generally be 
      binned to ~1Kx1K for the most space-efficient images.&nbsp; At lower voltages, 
      cameras have much better resolution and maps could be taken unbinned, although 
      binning by 2 will still provide images with more information per pixel.&nbsp; 
      The same is true for direct detectors at higher voltages.&nbsp; A direct detector camera in 
      counting mode is a special case; it has good information content in unbinned 
      images but the dose rate needs to be kept in the appropriate range for counting 
      mode.&nbsp; Thus, you could take map images unbinned with relatively long 
      exposures, or use binning by 2 with shorter exposures.&nbsp; In any case, 
      binning must be considered in conjunction with the magnification being used.&nbsp; 
      For mapping, a particular resolution or pixel size is needed to achieve the 
      desired level of detail. If you double the binning you need to increase the 
      magnification to compensate.&nbsp; If you are constrained to stay above a 
      certain magnification, that in turn may dictate the binning needed to prevent 
      huge maps.</P>
    <P>The memory use of maps is minimized by 
      an option (in the Navigator menu) to convert maps to bytes, which is on by 
      default. With this conversion, a map will typically occupy as many bytes as 
      pixels (e.g., a 10K by 10K image will require 100 MB). Without the conversion, 
      a map will take 3 times as much memory because the image is stored as 2-byte 
      integers and an additional byte array of the same size is needed for display. 
      You might need to turn off the option if the byte conversion is truncating the 
      intensities inappropriately so that you cannot see light or dark details. If 
      this occurs, turn off the conversion, read in the map, and type new values in 
      the White or Black text boxes of the Image Display control panel to keep the 
      desired intensities from being truncated. Be sure to turn the option back on.</P>
    <P>Even when conversion to bytes is on, the acquisition of a new map will take 3 
      times as much memory as the number of pixels, because the scaling to bytes 
      cannot be known until the whole montage is acquired. As soon as the montage is 
      designated as a map, however, it will be converted to bytes and the extra 
      memory will be available again. If the program cannot get memory for the 
      initial overview image when acquiring a montage, it will increase the binning 
      of this image to reduce the memory requirement. After you make such an image a 
      map, you can then reload it to see it at full resolution, since this will 
      require less memory.</P>
    <P>If performance starts to suffer, use the Task Manager to assess the memory and 
      swap file usage. Also notice the memory usage indicator in the Buffer Control 
      Panel. To recover the memory occupied by a map in a higher buffer, make the 
      image be the current one and use the Delete button in that control panel. If 
      you are going to use the Navigator extensively, get as much memory as possible 
      for the computer and make sure the swap file space is large (1 GB). Because the 
      behavior of the computer is usually atrocious when significant swapping occurs, 
      it is probably preferable to set the TotalMemoryLimitMB property to prevent the 
      program from requesting large amounts of memory for montage overviews when 
      memory use is near the limit (See <A HREF="about_properties.htm#general_properties">
        General entries</A> ).</P>
