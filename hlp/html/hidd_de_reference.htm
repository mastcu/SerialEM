        Server Reference Maker Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog is used to acquire dark and gain references for normalization of 
      images in the Direct Electron server.&nbsp; The server itself manages all of the 
      multiple acquisitions and summing operations required.&nbsp; The server keeps 
      track of references separately for different settings of the frames per second 
      (FPS).&nbsp; This dialog allows you to set the essential parameters for all of 
      the kinds of references needed; i.e. 6 kinds when electron counting is available 
      and otherwise 2 kinds.&nbsp; The exposure time and the number of acquisitions 
      are stored separately for each kind of reference.&nbsp; There is no intrinsic 
      distinction between a linear and counting dark referenceoe between a linear and 
      pre-counting gain reference other than the FPS used.&nbsp; The dialog has all these 
      different options to facilitate acquisitions when different FPS&#39;s are used for 
      the two modes, but there is no need to take both kinds if the two modes have the 
      same FPS.</p>
    <p>When run from a Setup button in the Navigator <A HREF="hidd_navacquire.htm">Acquire at Items
          dialog box</A>, the dialog is opened in a restricted mode where you can see 
      and change the settings for acquiring a dark reference with the current Record 
      parameters.&nbsp; Specifically, it will be set for a dark reference with the 
      current Record operating mode and Record settings for using hardware binning and 
      a hardware ROI rather than for the options selected when this dialog was last 
      run, and the latter selections will not be changed after closing the dialog from 
      this mode.</p>
    <p><b>Type of Processing: Linear - Pre-counting - Post-counting</b></p>
    <p>When electron counting is available, this set of radio buttons in included to 
      allow you to make all of the needed references.&nbsp; Select <b>Linear</b> to 
      make dark or gain references using the current FPS set for Linear mode.&nbsp; 
      Select <b>Pre-counting</b> to make such references using the current FPS for 
      counting mode.&nbsp; There is nothing intrinsically different between these 
      references except for the FPS, so if you do not have different FPS values for 
      the two modes, separate references are not needed.&nbsp; Select <b>Post-counting</b> to 
      make a gain reference to apply after electron counting at native resolution, and
      <b>Super-resolution</b> to make a reference for super-resolution counting images.</p>
    <p><b>Type of Reference: Dark - Gain</b></p>
    <p>Select whether to make a dark or a gain reference; only a gain reference can be 
      made if <b>Post-counting</b> or <b>Super-resolution </b>is selected.</p>
    <p><b>Frames per Second</b></p>
    <p>This text box shows the FPS at which the reference will be taken.&nbsp; If 
      electron counting is available, it allows you to set the FPS here instead of in 
      the <a href="hidd_camerasetup.htm">Camera Setup</a> dialog.&nbsp; If you change 
      the setting here, it will become the current FPS for acquisitions in the given 
      mode. </p>
    <p><b>With hardware binning by 2</b></p>
    <p>This checkbox appears if hardware binning is available; hardware binning will 
      be used if it is selected.&nbsp; The reference collected will be valid only with 
      hardware binning selected in the Record parameters.</p>
    <p><b>Use hardware ROI with current Record subarea</b></p>
    <p>This checkbox appears if hardware ROI (region of interest or subarea readout) 
      is available.&nbsp; Subarea acquired will be whatever is currently selected for 
      the Record parameters in the <a href="hidd_camerasetup.htm">Camera Setup</a> 
      dialog.&nbsp; Thus, the subarea needs to be set there first, and this option is 
      disabled if there is no subarea set. The reference collected will be valid only 
      with hardware ROI and this same subarea selected in the Record parameters.</p>

    <p>
      <b>Exposure time</b></p>
    <p>
      Enter the exposure time to use for each individual image to be acquired by the 
      server.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Number of acquisitions</b></p>
    <p>
      Enter or use the spin button to select the number of individual images to take 
      and average in the server.</p>
    <p>
      When you press the <b>Yes</b> button, the program will initiate the 
      acquisitions; the status bar will show the number done.&nbsp; If you press <b>
      Cancel</b>, parameter changes will be discarded.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>RUN</strong></p>
    <p>
      Press this button to start the 
      acquisition of the reference.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Save &amp; Close</strong></p>
    <p>
      Press this button to close the dialog without acquiring a reference, but saving 
      all parameter changes that have been made.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cancel</strong></p>
    <p>
      Press this button to close the dialog without saving parameter changes, with one 
      exception.&nbsp; If you change the FPS and switch between linear and counting 
      modes, the new FPS value is stored as the FPS for that mode when you leave the 
      mode.</p>
