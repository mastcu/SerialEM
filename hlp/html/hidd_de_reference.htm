        Server Reference Maker Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog is used to acquire dark and gain references for normalization of 
      images in the Direct Electron server.&nbsp; The server itself manages all of the 
      multiple acquisitions and summing operations required.&nbsp; The server keeps 
      track of references separately for different settings of the frames per second 
      (FPS).&nbsp; This dialog allows you to set the essential parameters for all of 
      the kinds of references needed; i.e. 5 kinds when electron counting is available 
      and otherwise 2 kinds.&nbsp; The exposure time and the number of acquisitions 
      are stored separately for each kind of reference.</p>
    <p><b>Type of Processing: Linear - Pre-counting - Post-counting</b></p>
    <p>When electron counting is available, this set of radio buttons in included to 
      allow you to make all of the needed references.&nbsp; Select <b>Linear</b> to 
      make dark or gain references using the current FPS set for Linear mode.&nbsp; 
      Select <b>Pre-counting</b> to make such references using the current FPS for 
      counting mode.&nbsp; There is nothing intrinsically different between these 
      references except for the FPS, so if you do not have different FPS values for 
      the two modes, separate references are not needed.&nbsp; Select <b>Post-counting</b> to 
      make a gain reference to apply after electron counting.</p>
    <p><b>Type of Reference: Dark - Gain</b></p>
    <p>Select whether to make a dark or a gain reference; only a gain reference can be 
      made if <b>Post-counting</b> is selected.</p>
    <p><b>With hardware binning by 2</b></p>
    <p>This checkbox appears if hardware binning is available; hardware binning will 
      be used if it is selected.</p>

    <p>
      <b>Exposure time</b></p>
    <p>
      Enter the exposure time to use for each individual image to be acquired by the 
      server.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Number of acquisitions</b></p>
    <p>
      Enter or use the spin button to select the number of individual images to take 
      and average in the server.</p>
    <p>
      When you press the <b>Yes</b> button, the program will initiate the 
      acquisitions; the status bar will show the number done.&nbsp; If you press <b>
      Cancel</b>, parameter changes will be discarded.</p>
