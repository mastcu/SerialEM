    <P>
      This section provides an introduction to autofocusing in SerialEM then describes 
      strategies for dealing with various kinds of autofocus problems.</P>
    <P>
      Autofocusing is done in SerialEM with the classic method of tilting the beam and 
      measuring how much the image shifts.&nbsp; That operation is illustrated in this 
      diagram.&nbsp; On the left, the specimen is in the object plane, and a particular 
      point on the specimen always projects to the same point in the image plane 
      regardless of the beam tilt, provided that the pivot points in the optical 
      system are properly aligned to achieve this.&nbsp; On the right, with the 
      specimen out of the object plane, differently tilted beams passing through the 
      same point on the specimen project to different places in the image plane, and 
      thus the image appears to shift when the beam is tilted.&nbsp; In the diagram, 
      the image will shift by a distance proportional to the distance between the 
      points where the two tilted beams cross the object plane.&nbsp; The amount of shift will 
      thus be approximately proportional to the distance from 
      focus, and also to the amount of beam tilt.</P>

    <p>
      After the autofocus routine measures the current defocus, it changes the defocus 
      by the amount needed to reach the target defocus that you have selected; 
      typically a few tenths of microns of underfocus for stained samples and several 
      microns for cryosamples (with negative numbers for underfocus).&nbsp; However, if 
      the change is very large, the program will limit the change to a set amount (16 
      microns by default) and repeat the operation.&nbsp; It may take several 
      iterations to change focus, and the program may even abort the operation if inconsistent results 
      are obtained during these iterations.</p>
    <p>
      Three variations on the autofocus operation, available in the Focus menu, are 
      useful when setting up autofocus or diagnosing problems with it.&nbsp; None of 
      them require an autofocus calibration to exist yet.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_reportshiftdrift">Report Shift &amp; Drift</a> 
        : This command will take the three images, correlate them, and report its 
        estimates of the shift induced by beam tilt and the amount of drift.</li>
      <li><a href="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_reportonexisting">Report On Existing</a> : 
        This command works with three images already present in the A, B, and C buffers 
        from an autofocus operation; it correlates them and reports the shift and drift.</li>
      <li><a href="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_showexistingcorr">Show Existing Corr</a> : 
        This command also works with three existing images; after correlating them, it 
        displays the cross-correlation between two of them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are several reasons why autofocus can be inaccurate or fail to work, 
      addressed in the following sections.</p>
      <P><B><FONT size="3">Specimen drift</FONT></B></P>
    <p>Since we are 
    measuring shifts between successive images, one source of inaccuracy is specimen 
    drift.&nbsp; This inaccuracy can be reduced by taking three images, with a 
    positive, negative, and positive beam tilt.&nbsp; The drift can be estimated by 
    the shift between the first and last image and subtracted off to determine just 
    the shift induced by the beam tilt. The option to take three images is set with 
    the Drift Protection entry in the Focus menu and should be left on unless there 
    is a good reason to turn it off.&nbsp; If the drift is constant over time, then 
    this procedure will eliminate its effect.&nbsp; More likely, it declines between 
    the first and second pair of pictures, such as when the stage settles from 
    tilting, so there may still be some residual effect from drift.&nbsp; To reduce 
    that effect, try to minimize the interval between images.&nbsp; With older 
    styles of CCD 
    camera, this is accomplished by taking a subarea with binning, as well as by 
    having a fairly short exposure time.&nbsp; With a direct detector, it is more 
    difficult to get fast images because the full chip is read out regardless, and 
    binning and subarea extraction occur in software.&nbsp; With some newer CCD 
    cameras, particularly fast-readout ones, using a subarea and binning make 
    relatively little difference, but the images are fairly fast anyway. Nevertheless, there are 
    other advantages in using smaller images that still apply with all cameras.</p>
      <P><B><FONT size="3">Fixed pattern noise</FONT></B></P>
    <p>
      If the images contain sufficient fixed pattern noise from the camera, this noise 
      can produce a strong peak in 
    the cross-correlation at zero shift, obscuring the correct peak.&nbsp; This 
    problem will show up particularly at low tilt, and it may even cause 
    problems in calibrating autofocus.&nbsp; (At higher tilts, one image is stretched 
      to compensate for stretching induced by the beam tilt, spreading out the noise 
      peak and reducing the problem.)&nbsp; It is easy to recognize that fixed 
    noise is a problem when more than one shift near 0,0 shows up during autofocus 
      calibration, or when autofocus reports a defocus very near zero even though 
    images are clearly shifted; however, sometimes the correlation fails only for 
    one of the two pairs of images, giving an intermediate defocus value.&nbsp; The 
      best way to diagnose this problem is to obtain images from an autofocus that 
      fails and use the <A HREF="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_showexistingcorr">Show Existing Corr</A> 
      command.&nbsp; The solutions to pursue in order, are:</P>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve the gain-normalization of the camera images.&nbsp; Gain references 
        should be taken with many tens of thousands of total counts in order to work 
        optimally.&nbsp; If your practice is to take gain references at a low number of 
        target counts per image to match the counts in typical low-dose images, then you 
        need to take many more reference images to compensate (e.g., 50 instead of 10).</li>
      <li>Increase the binning of the focus images, which will reduce the height of the 
        shrap peak at 0,0 relative to that of the real correlation peak. For typical 
        applications, binning to 2 or even 4 will probably not affect the accuracy of 
        the focus measurement, because there is sub-pixel interpolation when measuring 
        the shifts.&nbsp; However, the autofocus routine ordinarily does not apply binning to 
        images that it receives, so it is necessary to apply the needed binning during 
        acquisition.&nbsp; The exception to this situation is available for direct detectors 
        or other cameras where adequate binning may easily saturate a 16-bit image; for 
        these cameras, the <A HREF="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_set_ddd_min_binning">Set Min Binning</A> 
        command can be used to make the autofocus routine apply binning before 
        correlation when necessary.&nbsp; The set binning is applied automatically for 
        direct detectors, but for other cameras the camera property 
        &#39;UseMinDDDFocusBinning&#39; must be set for that setting to be used.</li>
      <li>Set program properties to apply a stronger high-frequency filter to the 
        images.&nbsp; This filter can be controlled by entries in the file 
        SerialEMproperties.txt: &#39;FocusFilterRadius2&#39; for the cutoff frequency (default 
        0.25/pixel) and &#39;FocusFilterSigma2&#39; for the Gaussian rolloff of the filter to 
        zero (default 0.05/pixel).&nbsp; Smaller values are used to apply more 
        filtering.&nbsp; In SerialEM 4.5, the <A HREF="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_set_filter_cutoffs">Test Filter Cutoffs</A> 
        command can be used to experiment with different values.&nbsp; Thus, with this 
        version, if you have the set of three images from a failed autofocus in buffers 
        A, B, and C, you can adjust either the filter with this command or the minimum 
        binning with <A HREF="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_set_ddd_min_binning">Set Min Binning</A> then 
        run <a href="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_reportonexisting">Report On Existing</a> 
        to see if it gives a correct result.</li>
      <li>For target defocus near zero, use a negative &#39;autofocus offset&#39; to have the 
        images taken at a defocus sufficiently different from zero.&nbsp; In that case, 
        the program will reject a large correlation peak at 0,0 when there is another 
        reasonable-sized peak closer to the expected defocus.&nbsp; This central peak 
        rejection automatically takes care of moderate fixed-noise problems for low-dose 
        imaging with a large enough negative defocus (below about -3 microns). This 
        approach may reduce the absolute accuracy of the focus measurement but not 
        necessarily its reproducibility.</li>
    </ul>
      <P><B><FONT size="3">Low beam-induced shift at high tilt</FONT></B></P>
    <p>
      Some specimens show low or virtually no shift between the beam-tilted images at 
      the highest tilts, usually only above about 50 degrees.&nbsp; The sign of this 
      problem is a measured defocus near zero even when the defocus is several microns 
      or more, coupled with the absence of appropriate shifts between the autofocus 
      images.&nbsp; If the target defocus is not also very near zero, then the program 
      will repeatedly change the focus by the target value, resulting in a runaway 
      focus.&nbsp; There is a procedure, <A HREF="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_checkautofocus">Check Autofocus</A>, 
      that can be run to check for this kind of problem; it measures defocus 5 microns 
      above and below the current defocus and reports how much of the actual focus 
      change it can detect.&nbsp; This routine can be run automatically at the start 
      of a tilt series, which is useful when running tilt series in one direction from 
      high tilt.&nbsp; There are two different strategies for dealing with the 
      problem.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some users have found that the problem occurs mainly when the beam-induced 
        shift is largely perpendicular to the tilt axis, and that it helps to choose a 
        beam tilt direction that makes the image shift parallel to the tilt axis.&nbsp; 
        In order to use this solution, you need to find this direction, then calibrate 
        autofocus for that beam tilt direction.&nbsp; With the <A HREF="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_set_tilt_direction">Set Tilt Direction</A> 
        command, you can pick one of 4 directions, spaced 45 degrees apart.&nbsp; To 
        find the right direction, select a direction, run <A HREF="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_reportshiftdrift">Report 
        Shift &amp; Drift</A>, and toggle through the images to visualize the direction 
        of shift.&nbsp; Repeat for each direction and pick the one where the direction 
        of shift is closest to parallel to the tilt axis.&nbsp; If you actually have a 
        failure case at high tilt, you should also see whether that direction indeed 
        gives the best shift.&nbsp; Calibrate autofocus with best direction selected, 
        and use it thereafter.</li>
      <li>Set an autofocus offset that is the negative of the target defocus; i.e., a 
        positive offset for the typical negative target.&nbsp; This is not a very good 
        solution; it will prevent runaway focus but not fix an incorrect defocus.&nbsp; 
        When running a tilt series in one direction from high tilt, you need to get the 
        focus right at high tilt before starting and hope that it does not get off very 
        much before autofocus starts working better. The strategy should work better 
        when running bidirectionally from zero tilt, because the specimen will be at the 
        proper focus when it reaches the troublesome tilts, and the program can predict 
        how focus should change as it goes through the final tilts.</li>
