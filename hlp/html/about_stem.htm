      <P>SerialEM supports STEM imaging on Thermo/FEI microscopes through either a 
        Thermo/FEI STEM unit or a Gatan DigiScan unit, and on JEOL microscopes through a 
        DigiScan unit, or through the native JEOL interface on most newer scopes.&nbsp; The following features
        are noteworthy, and the links are to help sections with more explanation and
        detail:</P>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic aspects of behavior in STEM mode, such as beam blanking and image
        contrast reversal, are governed by options in the <A HREF="hidd_stemcontrol.htm">STEM Control panel</A>.</li>
      <li>Detectors can be selected for acquisition, and multiple detectors can be
        acquired from simultaneously to the extent possible.&nbsp; The
        <A HREF="hidd_camerasetup.htm">Camera Setup dialog</A> allows control of image
        acquisition and the selection of detectors, as described in the section
        <A HREF="hidd_camerasetup.htm#STEMcontrols">Controls in STEM Mode.</A></li>
      <li>Focus can be changed dynamically while scanning to keep a tilted specimen in
        focus.&nbsp; With Thermo/FEI STEM, accurate dynamic focusing requires calibrating the
        timing of the scan for the particular acquisition conditions, as described in
        <A href="menu_calibration.htm#hid_calibration_quick_flyback_time">
    Quick Flyback Time</A>.</li>
      <li>On a Thermo/FEI, both nanoprobe and microprobe mode are recognized and can be
        calibrated separately for effective use.</li>
      <li>With Thermo/FEI STEM, manual focusing must be done only with the lens being 
        used by SerialEM.&nbsp; For Tecnais, this was found to be the objective lens, so 
        focusing should not be done with objective and condenser (&#39;IIntensity &amp; Objective&#39; in the TEM User 
        Interface) or condenser only.&nbsp; For Krios, the C3 lens is used, so focusing 
        with condenser only should be chosen in the TEM User Interface.&nbsp; In 
        general, you can open System Status and see which lens changes when SerialEM 
        changes focus, then make sure that focusing through the hand panels uses the 
        same lens.</li>
      <li>Tilt series can be acquired in STEM mode; aspects that are different from TEM
        mode are described in <A HREF="hidd_tiltseries.htm#tss_stem">Tilt Series in STEM Mode</A>.</li>
      <li>Images from more than one detector can be saved during a tilt series with the
        aid of the <A HREF="hidd_tsextrafile.htm">Tilt Series Extra Output dialog</A>.
      </li>
      <li>To deal with problems caused by tracking and focusing images not being
        centered on Record images, the shifts between these image types can be
        calibrated quickly and then applied during a tilt series (see
        <a href="menu_tasks.htm#hid_tasks_assess_interset_shifts">Assess Interset Shifts</a>).</li>
      <li>Low Dose mode can be used in STEM mode, either to reduce specimen exposure or
        to provide versatile control over magnifications for tracking and focusing.</li>
      <li>Montaging can be done and the Navigator can be used in STEM mode.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some features do not work in STEM mode: beam autocentering, specimen cooking,
      assessing angular ranges, and checking autofocus.</p>
    <p>
      The configuration and calibration of SerialEM for STEM mode is described in
      <a href="setting_up_serialem.htm#STEM_setup">Setting Up STEM</a>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Autofocusing</b></p>
    <p>
      Autofocusing is done by analyzing the power spectra of a series of Focus images.&nbsp;
      It proceeds in two phases.&nbsp; In the first phase, the program does a simple
      analysis of the total power over a certain spatial frequency range, after
      subtracting a background power level.&nbsp; It changes focus in whatever
      direction increases power over that at the current defocus, and moves in
      relatively coarse steps until it reaches a focus where power falls off again.&nbsp;
      It then takes images at finer focus steps so that there are at least two images
      on each side of the image with the best focus.&nbsp; These five images allow the
      second phase of analysis, in which it derives a measure of beam size for each of
      the 4 adjacent images by comparing the shape of its power spectrum with that of
      the best focused image.&nbsp; This measure varies linearly with distance from
      focus, so it is possible to fit a pair of lines to the measured sizes and take
      focus as the intersection between the two lines.&nbsp; Because of this
      interpolation method, it is not necessary to search for and take an image at
      exact focus.</p>
    <p>
      This method requires that there be enough features in the Focus images to give
      reliable power spectra for the analysis.&nbsp; The situation is more challenging
      than for autofocusing in TEM, where a few high-contrast particles on a
      featureless background can give an adequate cross-correlation for determining
      beam-tilt-induced image shift.&nbsp; It is definitely necessary to pay attention
      to whether the focus area has enough image detail, and it may be necessary to
      use larger images (center half instead of center quarter for Thermo/FEI STEM, or with
      the magnification increased by 2 instead of 4 for DigiScan).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Another limitation of the analysis is that the total power measure becomes
      insensitive for very blurred images, beyond ~5 microns of defocus.&nbsp; The
      first phase of the search may thus fail to find a peak in the power within a
      reasonable number of steps.&nbsp; When this occurs during tasks, tilt series, or
      scripts, the program stops with an error message.&nbsp; When it occurs after
      autofocus was started manually, you are given the choice of whether to stop
      (without modifying defocus) or to continue searching from the last defocus
      tested.</p>
