      <P>SerialEM supports STEM imaging on JEOL microscopes through a Gatan DigiScan 
        unit, and on FEI microscopes through either an FEI STEM unit or a DigiScan unit, 
        although the latter has not been tested on an actual FEI scope.&nbsp; The following features 
        are noteworthy, and the links are to help sections with more explanation and 
        detail:</P>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic aspects of behavior in STEM mode, such as beam blanking and image 
        contrast reversal, are governed by options in the <A HREF="hidd_stemcontrol.htm">STEM Control panel</A>.</li>
      <li>Detectors can be selected for acquisition, and multiple detectors can be 
        acquired from simultaneously to the extent possible.&nbsp; The 
        <A HREF="hidd_camerasetup.htm">Camera Setup dialog</A> allows control of image 
        acquisition and the selection of detectors, as described in the section 
        <A HREF="hidd_camerasetup.htm#STEMcontrols">Controls in STEM Mode.</A></li>
      <li>Focus can be changed dynamically while scanning to keep a tilted specimen in 
        focus.&nbsp; With FEI STEM, accurate dynamic focusing requires calibrating the 
        timing of the scan for the particular acquisition conditions, as described in 
        <A href="menu_calibration.htm#hid_calibration_quick_flyback_time">
    Quick Flyback Time</A>.</li>
      <li>On an FEI, both nanoprobe and microprobe mode are recognized and can be 
        calibrated separately for effective use.</li>
      <li>Tilt series can be acquired in STEM mode; aspects that are different from TEM 
        mode are described in <A HREF="hidd_tiltseries.htm#tss_stem">Tilt Series in STEM Mode</A>.</li>
      <li>Images from more than one detector can be saved during a tilt series with the 
        aid of the <A HREF="hidd_tsextrafile.htm">Tilt Series Extra Output dialog</A>.
      </li>
      <li>To deal with problems caused by tracking and focusing images not being 
        centered on Record images, the shifts between these image types can be 
        calibrated quickly and then applied during a tilt series (see
        <a href="menu_tasks.htm#hid_tasks_assess_interset_shifts">Assess Interset Shifts</a>).</li>
      <li>Low Dose mode can be used in STEM mode, either to reduce specimen exposure or 
        to provide versatile control over magnifications for tracking and focusing.</li>
      <li>Montaging can be done and the Navigator can be used in STEM mode.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some features do not work in STEM mode: beam autocentering, specimen cooking, 
      assessing angular ranges, and checking autofocus.</p>
    <p>
      The configuration and calibration of SerialEM for STEM mode is described in
      <a href="setting_up_serialem.htm#STEM_setup">Setting Up STEM</a>.</p>

      <b>Autofocusing</b></p>
    <p>
      Autofocusing is done by analyzing the power spectra of a series of Focus images.&nbsp; 
      It proceeds in two phases.&nbsp; In the first phase, the program does a simple 
      analysis of the total power over a certain spatial frequency range, after 
      subtracting a background power level.&nbsp; It changes focus in whatever 
      direction increases power over that at the current defocus, and moves in 
      relatively coarse steps until it reaches a focus where power falls off again.&nbsp; 
      It then takes images at finer focus steps so that there are at least two images 
      on each side of the image with the best focus.&nbsp; These five images allow the 
      second phase of analysis, in which it derives a measure of beam size for each of 
      the 4 adjacent images by comparing the shape of its power spectrum with that of 
      the best focused image.&nbsp; This measure varies linearly with distance from 
      focus, so it is possible to fit a pair of lines to the measured sizes and take 
      focus as the intersection between the two lines.&nbsp; Because of this 
      interpolation method, it is not necessary to search for and take an image at 
      exact focus.</p>
    <p>
      This method requires that there be enough features in the Focus images to give 
      reliable power spectra for the analysis.&nbsp; The situation is more challenging 
      than for autofocusing in TEM, where a few high-contrast particles on a 
      featureless background can give an adequate cross-correlation for determining 
      beam-tilt-induced image shift.&nbsp; It is definitely necessary to pay attention 
      to whether the focus area has enough image detail, and it may be necessary to 
      use larger images (center half instead of center quarter for FEI STEM, or with 
      the magnification increased by 2 instead of 4 for DigiScan).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Another limitation of the analysis is that the total power measure becomes 
      insensitive for very blurred images, beyond ~5 microns of defocus.&nbsp; The 
      first phase of the search may thus fail to find a peak in the power within a 
      reasonable number of steps.&nbsp; When this occurs during tasks, tilt series, or 
      scripts, the program stops with an error message.&nbsp; When it occurs after 
      autofocus was started manually, you are given the choice of whether to stop 
      (without modifying defocus) or to continue searching from the last defocus 
      tested.</p>
