      <P>This dialog box allows you to acquire a series of images at high tilt in order 
        to determine the usable range for a tilt series. After the series is acquired, 
        you can examine the stack of images and use the <A HREF="hidd_tssetangle.htm">Tilt 
          Series Range Viewer dialog</A> to pick which angles should be the limiting 
        angles for a tilt series. Your chosen angles will then be imported into the <A HREF="hidd_tiltseries.htm">
          Tilt Series Setup dialog</A> the next time that you open that dialog. There 
        are diverse factors that govern a choice of highest tilt angle, including the 
        quality of images, the proximity of a grid bar, etc. Rather than trying to make 
        this choice for you, this dialog provides flexibility so that can acquire the 
        images needed to make the choice rapidly in a particular situation. The routine 
        that acquires the images does try to detect the highest suitable angle by 
        examining the mean intensity in the central part of the images.</P>
      <P>The program will maintain alignment to the position at which it starts. Thus, it 
        will record a lower-magnification reference image at zero tilt before it 
        starts, and then align to this at the end. If you choose to have series done at 
        both positive and negative angles, it will also align to this position between 
        the two series. If you choose the option to use the Warp Up procedure, the 
        program maintains alignment to the same position at higher tilts.</P>
      <P><B>Regular versus Low Dose mode</B></P>
      <P>Separate parameters are stored for low dose and regular imaging modes. In 
        addition, the two modes provide a different choice for the kinds of images to 
        be acquired (see below).</P>
      <P><B>Actions before taking image series</B></P>
      <P>These check boxes select which operations to perform before acquiring the 
        series:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>
          'Refine eucentricity' runs that routine before leaving zero tilt</LI>
        <LI>
          'Walk up' uses the Walk Up routine to maintain alignment to the starting 
          position; otherwise the program will simply tilt the stage to the starting 
          angle of the series. If this option is selected, the program will also align 
          successive images of the series unless the image shift bcomes too high.</LI>
        <LI>
          'Autofocus' runs the focusing routine at the starting tilt angle.</LI></OL>
      <P><B>Image series angles</B></P>
      <P>Enter the starting and ending angle and increment of the series. Enter positive 
        numbers; the negative of these values are used for a series in the minus 
        direction. The program will stop the series before the ending angle if image 
        intensity falls rapidly between a pair of images.</P>
      <P><B>Directions to sample</B></P>
      <P>Select 'Both' to have a series done on both sides of zero, 'Minus only' to have 
        a series at negative angles only, or 'Plus only' to have a series at positive 
        angles only.</P>
      <P><B>Take image series with</B></P>
      <P>Select the kind of images to be used for the series. In regular mode, the images 
        can be Trial (for speed) or Record (to assess quality), while in Low Dose mode, 
        the images can be View (to give a broader overview), Trial (useful if alignment 
        is being maintained), or Preview (to see the Record area itself).</P>
