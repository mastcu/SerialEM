      <P>This dialog is used to set how the tilt series controller responds to an error 
        during a tilt series that is run in batch mode from the Navigator. It also has 
        other settings particularly relevant running in the batch mode. An error is any 
        condition in which the program would stop with a message. The first choice is 
        the most critical one:</P>
      <P><B>General response to error during the series</B></P>
      <P>Here there are two choices:
      </P>
      <OL>
        <LI>
          The program can stop with the usual message box, which requires you to confirm 
          the message box, take appropriate action, and resume or terminate the tilt 
          series. If you have chosen to have emails sent when tilt series stop, then an 
          email will generally be sent as well. Choose this option if you want to be sure 
          to get through every selected tilt series, or if you are able to check progress 
          periodically or respond to an email and intervene in a timely fashion. The one 
          exception to&nbsp;stopping is&nbsp;given in the radio buttons immediately below 
          this choice, the rest of the settings in this dialog are irrelevant.</LI>
        <LI>
          The program can automatically terminate the tilt series and go on to the next. 
          Choose this option if you are running a long sequence of unattended series and 
          want to continue the data collection even if some series fail. If you choose 
          this option, then other choices in this dialog govern how the program responds 
          when there is an error that would ordinarily require you to make a choice 
          between several responses.</LI></OL>
      <P><B>After 3 images too dim or one dim Record in Low Dose Mode</B></P>
      <P>If you have chosen to have the program stop with a message box,&nbsp;this option 
        allows you to&nbsp;have automatic termination of the tilt series when images 
        are acquired that are too dim.&nbsp; The termination will occur at the point 
        when a message box would usually appear: in Low Dose mode, after one Record 
        that is too dim; otherwise, after three trials to obtain an adequate image.</P>
      <P><B>After failure to tilt to expected angle</B></P>
      <P>When the stage fails to tilt to the expected angle, the options are to terminate 
        the tilt series or to continue with it. Termination is the default on an FEI scope 
        because this condition usually arises from a pole touch; continuing is the 
        default on the JEOL because the less precise tilting there can generate this 
        failure when the tolerance property is not set high enough.</P>
      <P><B>When Record image loses too much area in Low Dose mode</B></P>
      <P>This decision point is reached in Low Dose mode when you have 'Repeat Record if 
        percentage of field lost is more than' checked and the given limit is exceeded. 
        The options are to take the Record again, continue with the existing Record 
        image, or terminate the series.</P>
      <P><B>When Record image is too dim in Low Dose mode</B></P>
      <P>The program has an expectation of how many counts should be in Record images, 
        and when there are too few counts, the behavior in regular mode is to retake 
        the image, while in Low Dose mode the decision is left to the user. The options 
        here are to take the Record again, continue with the existing Record image, or 
        terminate the series. If the option to retake the image is selected, it will 
        try to take it three time then terminate the series if the images are still too 
        dim. If the option to continue is selected, this should not result in a runaway 
        series of dark images, because it will still terminate the series if subsequent 
        tracking or focusing images are too dim after three tries.</P>
      <P><B>Autosave log and start new log for each tilt series</B></P>
      <P>If this option is selected, then the program will start a new log file for each 
        tilt series run from the Navigator, and will automatically keep the log file up 
        to date during the series. The log file name will be based on the name of the 
        output file of the series. If the file already exists, the program will make a 
        numbered variation on this name rather than replace an existing file. New logs 
        will be started automatically even if the <A HREF="menu_tilt_series.htm#hid_tiltseries_autosavelog">
          Autosave Log</A> option is not selected in the Tilt Series menu.</P>
    <P><b>Consider batch series successful or end first part of bidirectional series 
      at high angles</b></P>
    <P>This option can be selected to keep either dim images or a failure of autofocus 
      from being treated as an error in some cases when the tilt angle is high enough.&nbsp; 
      The angle is sufficiently high when it is either greater than the absolute angle 
      in the &#39;above&#39; text box (default 55 degrees) or within the number of degrees of 
      the ending angle in the &#39;within&#39; text box (default 5 degrees).&nbsp; This policy 
      applies during a batch series when a dim image or autofocus failure occurs near 
      the ending tilt angle of the series.&nbsp; It applies during any bidirectional 
      tilt series, batch or manual, when a dim image or autofocus failure occurs near 
      the &#39;Tilt to&#39; angle that is the high angle for the first part of the series.&nbsp; 
      In the latter case, the program terminates the first part of the series and goes 
      on to the second part automatically.</P>
    <P><b>Do similar at high tilt if intensity/exposure set for mean exceeds X times 
      its minimum value</b></P>
    <P>With this option checked, if intensity or exposure time is being varied to 
      achieve a target number of counts, the program will keep track of the cumulative 
      changes in whichever parameter is being varied and test whether it has increased 
      by more than the given factor from the lowest value that it has had in the tilt 
      series.&nbsp; If it does, and the angle fits the criteria described for the 
      previous option, the program will do one of three things: 1) end the first part 
      of any bidirectional tilt series and go on to the second part; 2) terminate a 
      batch tilt series and consider it successful; 3) stop with an error message when 
      not running a batch series.&nbsp; The latter stop will happen only once, not 
      again if you go on.</P>
    <P>This feature will not work if intensity changes are combined with scheduled 
      changes in exposure time.&nbsp; Also, if the tilt series is unidirectional, it 
      provides protection only on the ending side of the series, since it does not 
      start keeping track of changes until the first Record is saved.</P>
      <P><B>Close column or gun valves after message box is open X minutes</B></P>
      <P>Use this option to control whether the valves are closed (or filament turned 
        off, in some cases) when a message box has been open for the length of time 
        specified in the edit box. This setting will apply not just during batch tilt 
        series, but any time that certain message boxes are opened, including all 
        message boxes that could occur during a tilt series. If the valves do get 
        closed, you will be notified about this when you close the message box.</P>
