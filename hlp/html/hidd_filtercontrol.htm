      <P>This panel contains options for controlling the Gatan Imaging Filter (GIF) and 
        the magnification and intensity settings of the scope when operating the GIF. 
        On the JEOL with omega filter, the options related to lens modes, camera 
        selection, pixel size, and intensity are not needed and will not appear. The 
        energy shift on the JEOL is referred to as spectrum offset here.</P>
      <P><B>EFTEM Mode (FEI or JEOL with GIF only)</B></P>
      <P>The button will toggle EFTEM mode on and off on an FEI scope. When EFTEM mode is turned on and 
        the screen is up, the microscope will be placed in one of the EFTEM 
        magnifications. If the screen is down, the microscope will stay at a regular 
        magnification if the 'Regular mag with screen down' option is selected.</P>
    <P>For a JEOL with a GIF, the state of the button will reflect whether the program 
      detects that the scope is in GIF mode.&nbsp; Beyond that, its behavior depends 
      on whether SerialEM can directly detect and control GIF mode on the JEOL, which 
      is a new capability in SerialEM 3.6.&nbsp; If it can control GIF mode, the button will be 
      enabled; if it can only detect but not control GIF mode, the button will remain 
      disabled.&nbsp; If it cannot directly detect GIF mode, then it cannot determine 
      the state 
      when in low magnification mode, so this button is enabled in LM mode.&nbsp; In 
      that situation, it is up to the user to toggle this button if GIF mode is 
      switched on or off in LM mode.</P>
      <P><B>Refine ZLP</B></P>
      <P>This button will start a procedure for refining the alignment of the zero-loss 
        peak (ZLP). The procedure will use a slit of 20 eV, start at the current 
        alignment, and take pictures at progressively lower energies in 2 eV steps 
        until the edge of the slit is moved past the ZLP. It will generally work only 
        if the ZLP is already roughly aligned (within about 15 eV). If it fails to 
        detect the peak, it will try additional iterations with the starting position 
        shifted left or right by the slit width (except in Low Dose mode, where it 
        gives up right away to conserve dose). Pictures are taken with the Trial 
        parameters in normal mode or with the Preview parameters in Low Dose mode, 
        except that the routine will try to lower the exposure by a factor of 10 and 
        double the binning. A small existing energy loss setting in the filter 
        parameters will be taken as a starting position for the procedure and set to 
        zero at the end. This will occur automatically if the loss is less than half of 
        the slit width setting in this panel; if the loss is more than half but still 
        less than the slit width setting, the routine will ask whether you want to take 
        the loss as a starting pointing. The slit must be in for the loss to be treated 
        in this way. In Low Dose mode, the routine will look first at the properties of 
        the current area, if it has the slit in, then examine the properties of the 
        Record area.</P>
    <P>If the procedure fails to detect the ZLP, you may need to set or adjust the 
      property RefineZLPMaxMeanRatio.&nbsp; Run
        <a href="menu_calibration.htm#hid_calibration_setdebugoutput">Set Debug Output</a> 
        in the Calibration menu and enter &#39;F&#39; to see output 
      from the procedure (or turn on Administrator mode in SerialEM 3.7.3 or earlier).&nbsp; 
        The second column shows the mean counts and the third column 
      shows the difference in mean counts from the previous step, referred to as the 
      delta.&nbsp; The procedure finds the ZLP when the mean falls below the biggest 
      mean value by the RefineZLPMaxMeanRatio, which is 0.02 by default, <i>and</i> 
      the delta falls below the biggest delta value by 0.1.&nbsp; However, these two 
      criteria are allowed to trade off against each other, so if the delta falls by 
      much more than 0.1, the mean does not need to fall by as much as the criterion 
      mean ratio. Because of this, you will not need to raise RefineZLPMaxMeanRatio to 
      exceed the minimum ratio of mean to biggest mean that you see in the output.&nbsp; 
      Try raising the ratio by 0.02-0.03; repeat if necessary.</P>
      <P><B>Adjust Slit Offset (JEOL with no negative energy shift)</B></P>
      <P>If the filter allows only positive energy shifts, then several program features 
        will not work unless the slit is centered with an energy loss sufficiently far 
        from zero. These include the procedure for refining the ZLP, the ability to 
        apply magnification-dependent changes in the energy shift, and the procedure 
        for calibrating the mag-dependent shifts. This button will facilitate adjusting 
        the slit position so that it is centered on the ZLP with a positive energy 
        offset. After you press it, enter the desired offset and press OK. The filter 
        will be placed into spectroscopy mode with the slit in, allowing you to center 
        the slit on the energy-shifted peak. After you make this adjustment, press OK. 
        You should then be able to run the Refine ZLP routine to get the ZLP aligned as 
        well as it would be on a GIF.</P>
      <P><B>TEM mode with screen down (FEI scope, or JEOL with control of GIF only)</B></P>
      <P>This button determines whether you see an image at normal magnification in TEM 
        mode or in 
        the EFTEM reduced magnification when the screen is down. The normal 
        magnification provided by this option is almost always preferable on a phosphor 
        screen.&nbsp; However, if 
        you want to check the size or centering of the beam directly in EFTEM mode, or align the 
        crossover correction at lower magnification, you would turn this option off.&nbsp; 
        When there is a magnified display of the screen, e.g., on a FluCam, the option 
        has less value; it does allow you to see what is in the field of view at a given 
        magnification.&nbsp; </P>
      <P><B>Filter (slit in)</B></P>
      <P>Select this option to insert the slit and acquire energy-filtered images. The 
        check box will also reflect the current state of the slit when other programs 
        modify it. When the slit is inserted, the specified energy loss (either zero or 
        the amount in the 'Loss' text box), plus the mag-dependent energy shift, if 
        any, is used to set the filter's spectrum offset. If the slit is not inserted, 
        then spectrum offset is maintained at zero.</P>
      <P><B>Slit width</B></P>
      <P>Enter a width in electron volts into the text box, or use the spin buttons to 
        increase or decrease the width by 5 eV. The slit is set to this width 
        regardless of whether it is inserted or not.</P>
      <P><B>Zero loss</B></P>
      <P>Once filtered imaging is selected, you can filter at either zero loss or a 
        specific energy loss. This check box allows you switch easily between the two. 
        With the box checked, images will be taken of the zero loss peak. With the box 
        unchecked, images will be taken at the energy loss specified in the 'Loss' text 
        box.</P>
      <P><B>Loss</B></P>
      <P>For filtered imaging, enter an energy loss in electron volts into the text box, 
        or use the spin buttons to increase or decrease the loss by 1 eV.
      </P>
      <P><B>Adjustment readout</B></P>
      <P>This text shows the energy shift that will be applied to compensate for 
        magnification, slit width, and ZLP alignment changes if the 'Do mag-dependent 
        energy shifts' option is selected. The value is set to zero when SerialEM 
        detects that you have aligned the zero loss peak through 
        DigitalMicrograph or the FEI interface, it changes by the 
        calibrated amount of mag-dependent energy shift when you change magnification, 
        it changes by half of any change in slit width that you make, and it changes by 
        the amount determined by the Refine ZLP procedure. On a JEOL, the adjustment 
        will include the offset imposed to keep energy shifts positive. The factors 
        determining the adjustment value will be retained for up to 1 hour between 
        sessions of the program, so you should be able to exit and restart without 
        needing to realign the ZLP.</P>
      <P><B>Net offset readout</B></P>
      <P>This text shows the spectrum offset currently being applied. It should be zero 
        when the slit is not inserted, and the sum of your selected energy loss and the 
        adjustments being applied when the slit is inserted. It should match the value 
        for spectrum offset in an FEI scope EFTEM panel and is intended to reduce 
        confusion when you see a non-zero number over there.</P>
    <P><b>Clear Adjustment (GIF only)</b></P>
    <P>Set the underlying energy shift adjustment to zero and make this effective at 
      the current magnification and slit width, just as when the program detects that 
      the zero loss peak was aligned by DigitalMicrograph.&nbsp; This button is useful 
      if you align the ZLP before starting SerialEM, and then SerialEM uses an 
      inappropriate adjustment value from a previous run.&nbsp; If necessary, return 
      to the magnification and slit width at which the ZLP was aligned before pressing 
      the button.</P>
      <P><B>Match pixel size (GIF only)</B></P>
      <P>Select this option to have the program adjust the magnification to minimize the 
        change in pixel size when switching between EFTEM and regular magnifications. 
        If the option is not selected, you can get some rather large changes in 
        magnification because the EFTEM and regular lens programs do not match up very 
        well. This feature is not active in low dose mode, where magnifications are 
        defined as part of each exposure area.</P>
      <P><B>Match intensity (GIF only)</B></P>
      <P>Select this option to have the program change beam intensity when switching 
        between regular and EFTEM magnifications, so as to maintain a constant electron 
        flux per camera pixel. With this option active, you can set the beam to give a 
        particular screen current with the screen down, and get a predictable exposure 
        level when you raise the screen. This option and 'Match pixel size' can be 
        selected independently, and will operate independently. This feature is 
        disabled in low dose mode because intensities are defined as part of each 
        exposure area.</P>
      <P><B>Do mag-dependent energy shifts</B></P>
      <P>If this option is selected, the program will adjust spectrum offset to keep the 
        slit centered on a desired energy loss when magnification or slit width is 
        changed. In order for this to work correctly, mag-dependent energy shifts need 
        to be calibrated and you need to be sure to inform SerialEM whenever you align 
        the ZLP.</P>
      <P><B>Switch cameras automatically (GIF only)</B></P>
      <P>With this option selected, the program will automatically select the GIF or 
        upper camera when EFTEM mode is turned on or off, and it turns EFTEM mode on or 
        off depending on which camera is selected. To protect the upper camera from the 
        intense beam in EFTEM mode, this option is enabled only in Administrator mode.</P>
