    <P>The basic steps involved in acquiring a tilt series are quite simple: tilt by an 
      increment, adjust image position to keep features of interest centered, adjust 
      focus to maintain a desired level of defocus, and acquire and save an image. 
      However, several factors make this process considerably more complicated. 
      First, it is highly desirable to skip some of these steps as often as possible, 
      because of the time and specimen dose required to perform them on every tilt, 
      yet it is not trivial to skip steps without jeopardizing the quality of the 
      tilt series. Second, the need to track image position with a lower 
      magnification image when working at a high magnification, or with an image away 
      from the area of interest when trying to minimize dose, makes this operation 
      more complex. Third, things do go wrong that require manual intervention, and 
      the program must have the flexibility to allow for a variety of interventions.</P>
    <P>The part of SerialEM that manages tilt series acquisition is called the Tilt 
      Series Controller (TSC). It deserves to be thought of as an entity in its own 
      right because it takes control of many aspects of program operation. For 
      example, you will not be able to tilt, copy images to certain buffers, or save 
      images directly while the TSC is in control - you can do these things only 
      through the TSC.
    </P>
    <P>When the TSC is running, buffer usage is standardized as follows: images roll 
      from buffer A through buffer C as new images are acquired; buffer D is the 
      primary buffer for autoalignment, buffer E is a secondary buffer for aligning 
      low magnification images or Trial images in low dose mode; and buffer F can be 
      read into from a file. Copying to buffers E and F is disabled.</P>
    <P>You can suspend a tilt series to change the image alignment or focus. See the 
      help for the <A HREF="hidd_tsresume.htm">Tilt Series Resume dialog box</A> for 
      more details on what options are available when you do this. You can also back 
      up to previous tilt angles; see the help for the <A HREF="hidd_tsbackup.htm">Tilt 
        Series Back Up dialog box</A> for more details on this process.</P>
    <P><B>Minimizing tracking errors</B></P>
    <P>Running a tilt series continuously from one extreme tilt to the other can result 
      in the area of interest not being well centered at zero tilt. This can happen 
      either because of inaccurate tracking from high to low tilt, or because it was 
      difficult to recognize the correct center position at the starting tilt angle. 
      SerialEM has several features that can help prevent this problem. One is the 
      'Walk up' procedure, which allows one to start at zero tilt (or a higher tilt 
      if desired) and tilt up to the starting angle in a series of coarse increments 
      with tracking images that are successively aligned to each other. This could be 
      particularly useful when it is hard to recognize the features of interest at 
      high tilt. You can activate the 'Walk Up' procedure yourself (from the Tasks 
      menu) before you start the TSC, or you can activate the TSC at a low tilt angle 
      and have it walk up to the starting tilt angle.</P>
    <P>The second feature that may help tracking is called a 'mid-tilt anchor'. This is an 
      image taken at around 40 to 50 degrees that the TSC can use as a reference when 
      the tilt series reaches that angle. The angle should be low enough so that 
      tracking is likely to be accurate from that point downward, but high enough so 
      that uncorrected Y-axis errors above that point are unlikely to cause data loss 
      in the reconstruction. (Note that because the region of interest is 
      foreshortened in the Y direction at high tilt, alignment errors can be quite 
      high in Y without losing any of the region of interest.) Angles in the range of 
      40-50 degrees should satisfy these criteria. If you are starting the TSC at a 
      low tilt angle and having it walk up to the starting angle, you can have it 
      leave an anchor at an appropriate angle. If you are going to high tilt before 
      starting the TSC, you can also specify an angle to leave an anchor at when you 
      use the 'Walkup &amp; Anchor' procedure.</P>
    <P>The fallback feature for fixing a tracking error is manual intervention. Simply 
      stop the series with the 'End' button. It will stop with a Record image in 
      Buffer A. Shift this image to the desired alignment with the right mouse 
      button. Then select the 'Resume' option, check the box 'Use image in buffer A 
      as reference for alignments' in the <A HREF="hidd_tsresume.htm">Tilt Series Resume 
        dialog box</A>, and push the 'GO' button.</P>
    <P><b>Bidirectional tilt series</b></P>
    <P>A different strategy, running the tilt series in both directions from zero 
      tilt, can be used to avoiding problems in reaching an initial high tilt angle 
      and in tracking accurately when coming down from a high angle.&nbsp; This 
      strategy is most useful in two situations, running multiple tilt series with 
      cryo-specimens automatically, or taking tilt series at very high magnifications, 
      but it may also be preferred even for single tilt series with some cryo-samples.&nbsp; 
      Its main disadvantage is that it introduces a discontinuity in the tilt series 
      at the starting angle.&nbsp; Almost certainly, tilt angles will not be evenly 
      spaced across this discontinuity because of backlash.&nbsp; Plastic sections 
      will shrink in the first half of the series, causing a substantial size change 
      between the zero-degree image and the starting image of the second half of the 
      series.&nbsp; On a few microscopes, stage imperfections cause an apparent change 
      in X-axis tilt between the two halves of the series.&nbsp; All of these problems 
      can be accounted for when aligning the tilt series in IMOD.&nbsp; In version 
      4.7, the eTomo user interface allows one to specify that a tilt series is 
      bidirectional and sets some appropriate parameters automatically.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The Scan Header function of Tomogram Setup also detects whether a series from 
      SerialEM is bidirectional and sets the option appropriately, because the header 
      of the output file has an entry in its second title line showing the starting 
      angle after &#39;bidir = &#39;.</P>
    <P>Although bidirectional series avoid some tracking difficulties, they involve a 
      different challenging step, returning to the starting angle for the second half 
      of the series.&nbsp; The program takes a lower magnification image at the 
      starting angle, the &#39;bidirectional anchor&#39; image, and aligns to this image after 
      returning to that angle for the second half of the series.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, 
      this re-alignment occurs after a much bigger tilt angle change and longer time 
      interval than any other alignment operation in a tilt series, so it may require 
      an image with a larger field of view than in other operations.&nbsp; For 
      example, in Low Dose mode, you may find that View images with a relatively small 
      field of view work in all other aspects of the series but are inadequate for the 
      anchor image.&nbsp; Because of this vulnerability, the <A HREF="hidd_tiltseries.htm">Tilt Series Setup dialog</A> 
      shows the anchor&#39;s field of view in microns and highlights the value when a 
      magnification is chosen that makes the value too small. </P>
    <P>In order to produce output files in the proper order, SerialEM restacks the 
      data from the first half of the series into a new file, in inverted order, 
      before it adds images from the second half.&nbsp; This restacking is done in the 
      background while the program is tilting back and realigning to the starting 
      position.&nbsp; When those operations are done, it then finishes the restacking 
      before tilting to the first angle of the second half.&nbsp; If a metadata 
      autodoc (.mdoc) file is being written, a new file will also be produced in the 
      proper order. </P>
    <P><b>Control of specimen exposure</b></P>
    <P>Because a sample becomes thicker in the direction of the beam when tilted, a 
      smaller fraction of incident electrons reaches the camera at higher tilts.&nbsp; 
      It is usually desirable to keep the signal-to-noise ratio in the acquired images 
      roughly constant through the tilt series, which requires greater exposure to the 
      specimen at higher tilts.&nbsp; The default (and original) method for increasing 
      exposure at higher tilts is to increase the beam intensity by condensing the 
      beam.&nbsp; The motivation for this approach is that beam-induced drift depends 
      primarily on the total current hitting the sample rather than its local flux; 
      condensing the beam thus tends not to increase this component of drift.&nbsp; 
      However, it is also possible to increase exposure time instead of beam 
      intensity, which is preferable in some cases.&nbsp; If you choose this approach, 
      it is important to assess whether drift-free images can be obtained with the 
      highest exposure time needed.</P>
    <P>Whichever method you choose for increasing specimen exposure, there are two 
      fundamentally different ways of controlling the change.&nbsp; One is to adjust 
      the intensity or exposure time after each Record image so as to maintain a 
      constant number of counts through the series.&nbsp; This method is generally 
      suitable for plastic-embedded samples.&nbsp; The other method is to adjust 
      intensity or exposure time by a formula based on the cosine of the tilt angle.&nbsp; 
      This method is preferred for cryo-samples because the total dose and its 
      relative distribution through the series can be determined accurately.</P>
    <P><B>Starting a tilt series</B></P>
    <P>When taking a tilt series in one direction, from one extreme angle to the 
      other, the TSC can be started either at a low tilt angle or at the starting tilt angle. 
      You can safely start at low tilt if you are fairly confident that:</P>
    <UL>
      <LI>
        The camera parameters (exposure time and drift settling) are suitable for 
        getting good pictures at high tilt.</LI>
      <LI>
        Autofocusing will work well enough to find focus at high tilt.</LI>
      <LI>
        Either the beam intensity or the exposure time can be adjusted automatically to give the desired counts in the image 
        without incurring problems: i.e., without the beam becoming too small and 
        encroaching on the camera area, or without a longer exposure time causing 
        excessive drift in the images.</LI></UL>
    <P>If you have doubts about any of these factors, you should go to high tilt before 
      starting the TSC, and make sure that images look good, that the specimen is 
      focused, and that the beam or exposure time can be adjusted properly. These conditions may be 
      satisfied if you have already done one tilt series on the specimen, in which 
      case letting the TSC start from low tilt would save some effort.</P>
    <P>Here is a sequence of steps for starting a tilt series:</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
        Decide if you are going to start at low tilt or go to high tilt before starting 
        the TSC.</LI>
      <LI>
        If you are going to high tilt before starting the TSC, refine eucentricity. 
        Select the 'Refine and Realign' command if you have already centered your 
        region of interest and plan to use the 'Walk Up' procedure; otherwise 'Fine 
        Eucentricity' is sufficient unless the magnification is high enough that you 
        might lose your selected area.</LI>
      <LI>
        Go to high tilt. Consider using 'Walkup &amp; Anchor' to save a mid-tilt anchor, as 
        described above.</LI>
      <LI>
        Make sure that the exposure settings for Focus, Trial, and Record give images 
        without drift.</LI>
      <LI>
        Do autofocus and see if it gives a well-focused Record image with the best 
        focus in the center of the field. If not, you can use the <A HREF="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_movecenter">
          Move Focus Center command</A> in the Focus menu to move the center of focus 
        to the middle of the field, or you can vary focus by hand. Once focus is found, 
        you should run the <A HREF="menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_measuredefocus">Measure 
          Defocus command</A> in the Focus menu and use the reported value to set the 
        target defocus.</LI>
      <LI>
        Set the beam intensity to give the desired level of counts. You can do this by 
        hand or use the <A HREF="menu_tasks.htm#hid_process_setintensity">Set Intensity 
          command</A> in the Tasks menu. This can be done with either a Trial or a 
        Record image in buffer A. When you select the command, the message in the 
        dialog box will show the mean counts that a Record image would give with the 
        present beam intensity. You can enter either a new number of counts, or a 
        factor by which to change the intensity. If you change the number by much (more 
        than 10-20%), you should take another image and look at the beam on the screen 
        to make sure it is not too small. If you cannot comfortably achieve the desired 
        value, just adjust the beam so it is large enough. You will be able to select 
        an option to reach the desired target number of counts at a lower tilt angle, 
        and the program will reach this target as fast as it can without making the 
        beam smaller than this initial setting.</LI>
      <LI>
        Take a final Trial image and center the features of interest.</LI>
      <LI>
        Open the <A HREF="hidd_tiltseries.htm">Tilt Series Setup dialog box</A> in the 
        Tilt Series menu and check the entries from top to bottom, paying particular 
        attention to the following:</LI>
      <LI>
        Check the starting and ending angles and angular increment.</LI>
      <LI>
        Make sure the delay time after tilting is appropriate for the holder and tilt 
        increment (small increments need less delay time; heavy holders need more).</LI>
      <LI>
        Decide whether you need low magnification tracking. This is recommended for 
        magnifications above 50,000, and might be needed at a somewhat lower 
        magnification if you are starting at a particularly high tilt angle (say, above 
        70 degrees).</LI>
      <LI>
        Make sure the limit on image shift is appropriate for the objective aperture 
        size and other conditions. On the 300 KV Tecnai or Polara, operating at a relatively low 
        magnification, montaging, and using low dose may all require a smaller limit on 
        image shift, perhaps as low as 1 micron. When the limit is reached, the TSC 
        will automatically reset the image shifts, move the stage to compensate, and 
        recover from the physical disturbance caused by this movement.</LI>
      <LI>
        Make entries for beam intensity control. Checking 'Do not increase intensity 
        above value for first saved image' is almost always a good idea. If you are 
        starting at high tilt and needed to set the beam to give less than the desired 
        target number of counts, check 'Keep intensity below current value (use if 
        intensity already set up)'. This will achieve that target as soon as possible 
        without overconstricting the beam. On the other hand, if you are starting at 
        zero tilt and know that you need to reduce the number of counts at high tilt, 
        fill in the desired target number in the 'Set intensity to keep mean counts of 
        Record images at' text box, check the 'Taper counts down to' option, and put 
        your reduced target for the highest tilt in the text box there.</LI>
      <LI>
        If you have had difficulty with autofocus at high tilt, you can select the 
        'Focus every time above' option and fill in the desired angle above which you 
        want to focus on every tilt.</LI>
      <LI>
        If you have a centered image in buffer A, select the option to 'Align to image 
        now in Buffer A'.</LI>
      <LI>
        If you are starting at zero tilt, you should select the option to 'Refine 
        eucentricity first' unless you have already done this.</LI>
      <LI>
        If you are starting at high tilt and have acquired an anchor image on the way 
        up, select the 'Use mid-tilt anchor' option and then use the up or down arrow 
        if necessary to indicate which buffer contains the anchor (it should be in the 
        right place if you used 'Walkup &amp; Anchor').</LI>
      <LI>
        Under 'Tracking control parameters', you typically need to consider only the 
        first line, which controls whether Record images will be repeated if they are 
        not centered well enough. If you never want this to happen, unselect the 
        option. The percentage here will determine the width of the area near the edge 
        of your reconstruction that is degraded because some images fail to contribute 
        data to it. A value of 5% is probably reasonable for most uses. If the 
        structures of interest nearly fill the camera frame at low tilt, then you might 
        want to reduce this to 2.5-3%. If you are working at very high magnification, 
        you might want to raise the value or unselect the option.</LI>
      <LI>
        If you are working at high magnification where tracking will be relatively less 
        precise, you may need to increase the value for 'Get tracking image when error 
        in X/Y prediction is &gt;' to avoid excessive tracking images. You may also 
        need to increase the criterion for 'Get new track reference if Record alignment 
        differs'.</LI></OL>
    <P>After you start the tilt series, the TSC will perform a number of preliminary 
      actions, which may include finding eucentricity, walking up, finding focus, 
      getting a first reference image, and adjusting intensity. Also, the program 
      will use the Reverse Tilt procedure to eliminate tilt backlash, so there is no 
      need for you to do this yourself. This procedure involves tilting up and back 
      by about 3 degrees, with lower magnification pictures taken before and after to 
      track the potentially large shift in position that can occur. If there is 'pole 
      touch' in this process, the program will try to compensate for this by taking 
      lower magnification tracking images during the first few tilts, until the 
      backlash is worked out.</P>
    <P><B>How predictions work</B></P>
    <P>The TSC minimizes the number of tracking and focusing positions by predicting 
      where the specimen will be after each tilt. It predicts position separately in 
      the X and Y directions (along and across the tilt axis) and uses image shift to 
      compensate; it predicts the position in Z and changes focus to compensate. At 
      the beginning of the tilt series, the information needed to make reliable 
      predictions accumulates gradually. After two tilts, there is enough information 
      to make simple extrapolations, but not to know how accurate they are. With data 
      from three or more tilts, the program can assess the accuracy of a prediction 
      from how well the positions fit a straight line. In addition, if predictions 
      were made on the previous tilt, the program can determine how far off they 
      were. Thus, at a given tilt angle, there are two kinds of prediction errors 
      available: the computed error of the prediction for the next angle, and the 
      actual error in the prediction for the current angle. Only when both of these 
      errors are low enough will the TSC rely on a prediction and skip a tracking or 
      focusing step.</P>
    <P>The accuracy of the prediction generally increases as more data become 
      available, but only as long as the positions change regularly. Because the 
      specimen and stage do not behave ideally, it is necessary to restrict the 
      positions used for the predictions to those from the most recent tilts. For 
      each axis, there is a maximum tilt range over which positions will be fit (a 
      parameter that can be set in the.) Moreover, the TSC may restrict the tilt 
      range used for a particular fit even more if it substantially in increases the 
      accuracy of the prediction. The number of points dropped from a prediction fit 
      is reported as 'nDrop' in the line describing the prediction. These limitations 
      are expressed in terms of tilt range rather than number of tilts because the 
      deviations from ideal behavior that limit the quality of predictions probably 
      occur over a certain range of motion independent of the number of steps. If you 
      have smaller a tilt increment, the predictions should be good over a larger 
      number of tilts.</P>
    <P>Certain events are considered to disturb the predictability of the system and 
      will cause the TSC to ignore some or all of the position data that are 
      available. These events include resetting the image shift, tilting back to redo 
      a Record image, and changing the alignment reference. If you stop then resume a 
      tilt series, the TSC will try to determine whether you have done something that 
      would jeopardize the predictions.</P>
