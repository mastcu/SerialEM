    <P>This dialog box allows you to set the conditions for pre-exposing (cooking) a 
      plastic section prior to a tilt series. If dose is calibrated for the selected 
      conditions, then you can expose for a specified dose. Otherwise, you can simply 
      set a time for the cooking. The general practice in Boulder to is to expose for 
      about 2000 electrons per square Angstrom. Cooking with a well-spread beam 
      should help to minimize warping of the section. Using the brightest spot for 
      the cooking will reduce the time needed.</P>
    <P><B>Setup mag and beam on scope</B></P>
    <P>When this button is turned off, the dialog just shows the current parameter 
      settings for the cooking. When the button is turned on, the microscope will be 
      put into the specified state and the parameters can be adjusted simply by 
      changing the magnification, spot size, and brightness on the scope.
    </P>
    <P><B>Mag/Spot size/Intensity/Dose displays</B></P>
    <P>The mag, spot size, and intensity readouts show the currently set parameters for 
      cooking, and are dynamically updated when 'Setup mag and beam on scope' is 
      turned on. The dose rate is derived from the spot size and intensity values, 
      and will show '-x-' when dose is not calibrated for those values. For an FEI scope 
        or JEOL scope with alpha, there will be an additional readout displaying the 
        probe mode or the alpha setting, respectively.</P>
    <P><B>Expose for dose of</B></P>
    <P>Select this radio button to cook until a specific dose is accumulated, and set 
      the desired dose with the text box and spin buttons. Cooking will work with 
      this selection only if dose is calibrated at the particular spot size and 
      intensity being used.</P>
    <P><B>Expose for time of</B></P>
    <P>Select this radio button to cook for a specific amount of time, and set the 
      desired time with the text box and spin buttons. You can always use this method 
      of cooking, even when dose is not calibrated</P>
    <P><B>Total time/dose readout</B></P>
    <P>This line shows the total time when cooking until a dose is reached, or the 
      total dose when cooking for a specified time. In either case, it will show 
      '-x-' if dose is not calibrated.</P>
    <P><B>Tilt to X degrees for cooking</B></P>
    <P>Select this option to have the scope tilt to the angle specified in the text box 
      for the duration of the cooking. Cooking at high tilt should be just as 
      effective in terms of the dose rate, while exposing a wider area. However, it 
      is essential that the specimen be close to eucentric before starting, so that 
      the area cooked at high tilt will actually contain the desired area.</P>
    <P>Note that if this option is not selected, the cooking will occur at whatever the 
      tilt angle is when the cooking routine is started.</P>
    <P><B>Restore specimen position after cooking</B></P>
    <P>With this option selected, the program will take a reference picture at an 
      appropriate magnification before starting, then take another picture at the end 
      and align the two. Since shrinkage might make it hard to align these pictures, 
      the program will search for a scaling of the second picture that maximizes the 
      correlation between the two. It reports this scaling as a shrinkage value.</P>
    <P><B>GO</B></P>
    <P>Use this button to close the dialog and start the cooking operation.</P>
