      <BR>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_setintensity"></A><B>Set Intensity command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to change the beam intensity so as to achieve a desired mean 
        level in images taken with Record parameters. When you select this command, the 
        program first computes the zero-tilt mean (mean of the tilt-foreshortened area) 
        of the image in buffer A. It then takes account of the exposure time and 
        binning of that image to determine what the zero-tilt mean of a Record image 
        would have been at the current beam intensity. The program presents a dialog 
        box in which you can enter the new intensity; the default value in this box is 
        the computed mean for a Record image at the current intensity. This value will 
        give you some idea of how big a change you are requesting. If you accept this 
        default, nothing will change. Enter the desired mean level.</P>
      <P>Since the program changes intensity by condensing the beam, it is possible that 
        the beam will become too small to cover the camera area. If you increase the 
        intensity by a substantial amount, you should check whether the beam still 
        covers the area before going on to tasks that rely on full exposures.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_set_dose_rate"></A><B>Set Dose Rate command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to change the beam intensity to give a desired dose rate on 
      the camera, in electrons per unbinned pixel per second, based on the counts in 
      the image in buffer A.&nbsp; The mean of the tilt-foreshortened area will be 
      used, as for the <a href="#hid_process_setintensity">Set Intensity</a> command.&nbsp; 
      The programs presents a dialog box showing the dose rate in that image and 
      asking for the new value.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_movebeam"></A><B>Move Beam command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to move the beam by a controlled amount. You can use it to 
        center the beam by first taking a picture with the beam condensed enough to 
        show much of its boundaries. Then click the left mouse button to set a display 
        marker point in the center of the beam. Next, select this command, and the 
        center of the beam will be moved to the center of the field. In general, the 
        beam will be moved by the amount that would move the marker point to the center 
        of the field.</P>
      <P>After you use this command, you need to take another picture to see the position 
        of the beam.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_centerbeam"></A><B>Center Beam command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>You can use this command to center the beam if the edge of the beam is fairly 
        sharp and appears in the currently active image. The program will analyze the 
        image to find the beam edge then solve for a circle that fits the edge. It will 
        then move the beam to move the center of that circle toward or to the center of 
        the image. The solution will be most accurate if the beam edge appears in 3 or 
        4 corners of the image, and will be fairly accurate when there is beam edge in 
        two corners of the image. With an edge in only one quadrant, the program will 
        be increasingly conservative in how much it moves the beam, the smaller the 
        piece of edge is. When the edge occupies less than 20 degrees, the beam will 
        simply be moved enough to get the edge out of the field, so do not expect the 
        beam to be centered in such situations. This command will not work if the beam 
        edge is not relatively sharp, so it will not work with some non-FEG scopes.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_autocenterbeam"></A><B>Autocenter Beam command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>You can use this command to center the beam automatically by taking an image 
        with the beam condensed so that its position can be detected reliably either 
        from the edges of the beam or from the average location of the beam in the 
        image. You must first set up the beam intensity at the current or a nearby 
        magnification and spot size, using the <A HREF="hidd_autocensetup.htm">Beam 
          Autocenter Setup dialog box</A> . The program will condense the beam, take 
        one or two images depending on the centering method, and restore the beam.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_setupautocenter"></A><B>Setup Autocenter command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to open the <A HREF="hidd_autocensetup.htm">Beam Autocenter Setup 
          dialog box</A> and set the beam intensity that will be used for 
        autocentering.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_eucentricity_coarse"></A><B>Eucentric - Rough command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command can be used to adjust the Z height to the eucentric point when the 
        Z height might be off by more than 5-10 microns, which can often be the case 
        when the specimen rod has just been inserted. This procedure will find 
        eucentricity to within about 0.5 micron. This is good enough for tuning the 
        microscope but not as accurate as the adjustment provided by the Eucentric - 
        Fine command, which should be run before starting a tilt series.</P>
      <P>This procedure does not make any attempt to keep the starting specimen location 
        in the field of view.</P>
      <P>The rough eucentricity procedure first switches to a low magnification (or, in 
        low dose mode, it uses the parameters of the View area). It takes pictures to 
        determine how far the specimen moves laterally upon tilting, starting with a 
        very small tilt increment and working up to a total increment of 8 degrees. It 
        may adjust the Z height more than once before finishing.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_eucentricity_fine"></A><B>Eucentric - Fine command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command can be used to adjust the Z height to the eucentric point when it 
        is already within 5-10 microns. It is thus a suitable procedure to use if you 
        have moved to a new location on the specimen grid since the last time 
        eucentricity was adjusted. It is recommended that you run this command before 
        starting a tilt series.</P>
      <P>This procedure does not make any attempt to keep the starting specimen location 
        in the field of view. It can be run when not at zero tilt, and the program will 
        return the stage to your pre-existing tilt at the end.</P>
      <P>The fine eucentricity procedure first switches to a low magnification (or, in 
        low dose mode, it uses the parameters of the View area). It then takes pictures 
        at a set of tilts between -24 and + 24 degrees. From the image displacements 
        during this series, it can compute both the distance in Z from the eucentric 
        point and the lateral displacement of the tilt axis from the optical axis. If 
        image displacements become too large, the program will adjust Z height then 
        repeat the procedure from the beginning.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_eucentricity_both"></A><B>Eucentric - Both command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to run the rough eucentricity procedure followed immediately by 
        the fine eucentricity procedure. This sequence does make any attempt to keep 
        the starting specimen location in the field of view.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_finerealign"></A><B>Refine &amp; Realign command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to run the fine eucentricity procedure while retaining an item 
        of interest centered in the field of view. The program will first take a 
        low-magnification reference picture, then do the fine eucentricity procedure, 
        then take another picture at the original tilt angle and use that to restore 
        the alignment. In low dose mode, the reference picture will be taken of the 
        View area. It is not necessary to be at zero tilt to run this command.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_settiltaxisoffset"></A><B>Set Tilt Axis Offset command (Tasks 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set the offset of the tilt axis from the optical axis, which 
        is used to keep image shift centered on the optical axis. If the tilt axis is 
        more than a micron from the optic axis, it is desirable to set this offset to 
        minimize specimen movements in Y and Z during tilting. The offset should be set 
        as a system-wide property. However, if this property setting is not adequate, 
        or if the offset varies significantly from place to place, this command can be 
        used to set the offset. It is placed in this menu because the lateral offset 
        from the Refine Eucentricity procedure indicates how much the offset should be 
        changed. When the command is selected, a dialog box comes up informing you of 
        the current tilt axis offset, and the total offset implied by the lateral 
        displacement reported in the last run of 
        Refine Eucentricity, if any. The default value in the box is the implied total 
        offset (or just the current offset, if Refine Eucentricity has not been run.) A 
        tilt axis offset has an effect only if you have selected 'Center image shift on 
        tilt axis' in the Image Alignment and Focus control panel.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_trial_in_ld_refine"></A><B>Use Trial in LD Refine command (Tasks 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to select whether the Trial area rather than the View area will 
        be used for the tilted images that are taken when refining eucentricity. The 
        View area will still be used for the initial and final tracking images when the 
        Refine and Realign procedure is used, and for the rough eucentricity procedure 
        when both rough and fine procedures are run together. Using the Trial area will 
        save a little dose but will reduce the range of Z heights over which the 
        procedure can run reliably. Also, if the specimen is not relatively flat along 
        the tilt axis, the Trial area rather than the Record area will be brought to 
        the eucentric height.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_walkup"></A><B>Walk Up command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to go from one tilt angle to another while retaining an item of 
        interest centered in the field of view. Typically this would be used to go from 
        zero tilt to a high tilt angle. After you select the command, you will 
        encounter a dialog box in which to enter the destination tilt angle. This 
        destination angle will be saved and will appear as the default angle the next 
        time you invoke the command.</P>
      <P>This procedure involves taking alignment pictures at a series of tilt angles, 
        with a tilt interval that is quite coarse at low angles and finer at high 
        angles. Image shift will be reset whenever it gets too high, but no 
        autofocusing is done. The pictures are taken with the Trial parameter set and, 
        if in low dose mode, the pictures are of the Trial area. If the magnification 
        is too high for reliable tracking, the pictures will be taken at a lower 
        magnification.</P>
      <P>If you choose a destination angle that is in the opposite direction from the 
        last direction of tilt, the routine will run the Reverse Tilt procedure first 
        to avoid losing the area of interest.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_walkupanchor"></A><B>Walk Up &amp; Anchor command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to do the same operation as in the Walk Up command but also 
        leave an image behind at a specified intermediate tilt angle. The image will be 
        left in the last image buffer and can be used as an 'anchor' for alignment 
        during a tilt series. The angle for the anchor image will be saved as the 
        default for the next use of this command and is the same as the angle that 
        appears for an anchor image in the <A HREF="hidd_tiltseries.htm">Tilt Series Setup 
          dialog box</A> .</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_use_view_in_lowdose"></A><B>Use View in LD command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to select whether the Walk Up routine will be run with the 
        View area when in Low Dose mode.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_setincrements"></A><B>Set Increments command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set the minimum and maximum tilt increments for the Walk Up 
        operation. The maximum increment is used at zero tilt, and the increment at any 
        tilt angle is either this maximum times the cosine of the angle, or the minimum 
        increment, whichever is greater. Your settings for these values are retained 
        between sessions of SerialEM.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_setupcooker"></A><B>Setup Cooker command (Tasks menu)</B></P>

          Setup dialog box</A> . The program will lower the screen to expose the 
        specimen, report in the log window as each tenth of the exposure is finished, 
        and continually update the status bar with the expected time remaining.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_assessanglerange"></A><B>Assess Angle Range command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to acquire a small series of images at high tilt in order to 
        determine the limits of the tilt range for a tilt series. There are options 
        that allow a series to be acquired as quickly as possible, or more slowly and 
        carefully, depending on what you wish to see in the high tilt images. These 
        options are set in the <A HREF="hidd_tsrange.htm">Tilt Series Range Finder 
          dialog box</A>.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_assess_interset_shifts"></A><B>Assess Interset Shifts command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>In STEM mode, use this command to measure the shifts between Record and other 
        images with current camera parameters.&nbsp; These shifts are compensated during 
        tilt series acquisition to make sure that tracking and focusing images are 
        centered on the Record area.&nbsp; The shifts are specific to the magnification 
        and the image size and binning, and also depend on exposure time when the scan 
        rate is relatively high.&nbsp; The shifts are not saved for different 
        conditions, so this command needs to be run as part of the routine tasks before 
        starting a tilt series, after camera parameters have been set up.&nbsp; The 
        Record exposure time can be varied during the tilt series, but the other 
        exposure times should be kept constant, or else the shifts will not be 
        considered valid.</P>
    <P>When not in Low Dose mode, the routine will measure the shift for a Trial image 
      and for a Focus image relative to Record.&nbsp; When in Low Dose mode, the 
      routine will always measure a shift for a Preview image.&nbsp; It will then 
      measure a shift for a Trial if Trial area is centered on Record, and a shift for 
      Focus if the Focus area is centered on Record.&nbsp; At the end, you should 
      scroll through the images to make sure they are well-enough aligned.&nbsp; If 
      the image in A is not aligned, you can align it with the right mouse button then 
      use the <A HREF="#hid_tasks_revise_cancel">Revise/Cancel Shifts 
          command</A>.&nbsp; If a different image is not aligned, you can try the command again 
      with a new image area, or eliminate the shifts with the <A HREF="#hid_tasks_revise_cancel">Revise/Cancel Shifts 
          command</A>.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_revise_cancel"></A><B>Revise/Cancel Shifts command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command either to indicate that an interset shift should be taken from 
        the alignment of the image in buffer A, or to eliminate the last measured 
        interset shifts.&nbsp; You will first be asked if you want the revise a shift 
        based on the alignment of the image in A.&nbsp; If you answer No, you will then 
        be asked if you want to eliminate the interset shifts.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_reset_realign"></A><B>Reset IS &amp; Realign command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to reset the microscope image shift (IS) while retaining an
         item of interest centered in the field of view. The program will take a
         reference picture, reset the image shift to zero and move the stage to
         compensate, then take another picture and align it to the reference picture. At
         the end, image shift will no longer be zero because of this alignment; in fact,
         it can be as much as one-quarter of the original image shift because of
        inaccuracy in stage movement. The reference picture will be taken at low
        magnification or, if in low dose mode, with the View parameters.</P>
      <P>If you just want to reset image shift without having a feature stay centered, 
        use the Reset Shifts button in the <A HREF="hidd_alignfocus.htm">Image Alignment 
          &amp; Focus panel</A> .</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_setiterationlimit"></A><B>Set Iteration Limit command (Tasks 
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to change the criterion that the Reset IS &amp; Realign 
        procedure uses to decide whether to reset the shift and realign a second time. 
        After resetting the shift, the program takes an image and aligns it to image 
        taken before the reset. If image shift is still greater than this criterion, it 
        will be reset again, and another image taken and aligned.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_usetrialinld"></A><B>Use Trial in LD command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Toggle this entry to switch between using the View and Trial areas for the Reset 
        IS &amp; Realign procedure. The View area is the default because the stage 
        movement involved in resetting the shift is unpredictable, and the larger field 
        of view of the View area is assumed to be needed to do the reset reliably. It 
        may be safe to use the trial area if your limit for resetting image shift is 
        small (~1 micron), if the field of view of the trial area is fairly large (2 
        microns), and if your stage is adjusted so that stage movements are reliable at 
        high tilt for the holder being used.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_reverse_tilt"></A><B>Reverse Tilt command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to reverse the direction of tilting while retaining an item of 
        interest centered in the field of view. For example, if you tilt up to a high 
        angle, center your item of interest, then try to start a tilt series by just 
        tilting back down, the specimen may move considerably because of backlash in 
        the stage. This problem can be avoided by using this command. The program will 
        take a reference picture, tilt far enough in the current direction to work out 
        the backlash, tilt back to the starting angle, then take another picture and 
        align it to the reference picture. The reference picture will be taken at low 
        magnification or, if in low dose mode, with the View parameters.</P>

      <P><A NAME="hid_special_skip_beam_shift_in_ts"></A><B>Skip Beam Shift in TS 
        command (Tasks - Specialized Options submenu)</B></P>
    <P>When using a phase plate on a JEOL microscope, the beam shift that accompanies 
      every image shift operation will change the centering of the phase plate.&nbsp; 
      Turn on this entry to suppress the beam shift for the alignment operations 
      involving image shift during a tilt series.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_special_piezo_for_ld_axis_shift"></A><B>Piezo for LD Axis Shift 
        command (Tasks&nbsp; - Specialized Options submenu)</B></P>
    <p>
      If there is a piezo plugin loaded that can provide stage movement along the tilt 
      axis, and the properties file contains both an entry 'UsePiezoForLDAxis' 
      specifying this piezo and an entry 'PiezoScale' defining the range and scaling 
      of this piezo, this option can be turned on to use this piezo movement as a 
      substitute for on-axis image shift between Record/View and Trial/Focus areas in 
      Low Dose mode.&nbsp; The option can be toggled only when Low Dose mode is off.&nbsp; 
      When Low Dose is turned on with this option enabled, the piezo is moved to the 
      end of its range appropriate for the Record area.&nbsp; Several restrictions are 
      also enforced: Focus and Trial are constrained to the same properties; 'Balance 
      Shifts' is turned off; rotation of the interarea axis away from the tilt axis is 
      turned off.&nbsp; The 'Position on tilt axis' entry can be negative or positive 
      as needed, but the stage will be moved to the other end of its range when the 
      sign is changed.</p>

      <A NAME="hid_special_disable_dark_trim_in_align"></A><B>Disable Dark Trim in 
      Align command (Tasks&nbsp; - Specialized Options submenu)</B></p>
    <p>
      Even when 'Trim dark borders in Autoalign' is not selected in the 
      <a href="hidd_alignfocus.htm">Image 
      Alignment &amp; Focus</a> control panel, this trimming happens automatically in three 
      cases: when in Low Dose mode, when doing a task at a lower magnification and not 
      in Low Dose mode, and 
      when the Navigator does Realign to Item.&nbsp; This option allows the automatic 
      trimming to be disabled in selected cases.&nbsp; Three dialog boxes will come 
      up.&nbsp; The first controls the trimming in Low Dose mode; enter 1 if you want 
      to disable it just when doing a tilt series, or 2 if you want to disable it 
      always.&nbsp; The second entry controls the trimming when doing tasks; again, 
      enter 1 if you want to disable it just when doing a tilt series, or 2 if you 
      want to disable it always.&nbsp; The third entry allows you to disable the 
      trimming when running Realign to Item.&nbsp; Note that the &#39;AlignTo&#39; script 
      command also has an optional entry to prevent trimming.&nbsp; The decision to 
      trim is made as follows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trimming is not done if &#39;AlignTo&#39; is run with that option set to prevent 
        trimming</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if doing Realign to Item, trimming is determined by the option set 
        here for Realign</li>
      <li>Or, if in low mag for another task and not in Low Dose, trimming is determined 
        by the option set here for tasks</li>
      <li>Or if in Low Dose mode, not doing a Realign, trimming is determined by the 
        option set here for Low Dose</li>
      <li>If not in Low Dose mode or doing Realign or a task, trimming is controlled by 
        the choice in the control panel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <A NAME="hid_specialoptions_allowcontinuousintasks"></A><B>Allow Continuous in TS command (Tasks&nbsp; - Specialized Options submenu)</B></p>
    <p>
      Ordinarily, the program will acquire images in single-frame mode for almost all 
      automated operations, even when using a camera parameter set that has continuous 
      mode set.&nbsp; If this option is selected, images acquired directly by the Tilt 
      Series Controller will be allowed to be taken in continuous mode if that mode is 
      set in the camera parameters.&nbsp; Such continuous acquisitions must be stopped 
      manually by the user before the tilt series can go on.&nbsp; This exception does 
      not apply to images taken when autofocusing or doing other tasks; all tasks 
      enforce single-frame mode.&nbsp; Thus, it applies to Trial and Record, as well 
      as to View and Preview images taken in Low Dose mode.</p>
    <p>
      <A NAME="hid_specialoptions_normalizeviaviewforau"></A><B>Normalize Via View 
      for Autofocus command (Tasks&nbsp; - Specialized Options submenu)</B></p>
    <p>
      When this option is selected, the program will switch to the View area in Low 
      Dose before going to the Focus area for autofocusing, unless it is currently in 
      Focus and arrived there from View.&nbsp; When &#39;Keep Focus and Trial identical&#39; 
      is selected in the Low Dose Control Panel, Trial and Focus are considered 
      equivalent for the purpose of deciding whether this normalization needs to be 
      done.</p>
    <p>
      <A NAME="hid_specialoptions_adjustfocusonprobemodechange"></A><B>Adjust Focus on Probe Mode Change command (Tasks&nbsp; - Special Option submenu)</B></p>
    <p>
      When changing between microprobe and nanoprobe TEM modes on FEI scopes, the 
      scope will restore the defocus last seen in a mode when returning to that mode.&nbsp; 
      With this option turned on, the program will try to maintain a constant 
      difference between the focus levels in the two modes. It does this by tracking 
      how much defocus changes during the time spent in one mode and imposing that 
      focus change on the scope's restored focus value when switching to the other 
      mode.&nbsp; This means that you can use autofocus in one mode and have the 
      required focus change applied when returning to the other mode.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>
      The option needs to be turned off in order to impose a needed focus difference 
      between the modes.&nbsp; As of SerialEM 3.7, focus differences are always 
      applied in Low Dose mode only when this option is on. </p>
    <p>
      If you want to &quot;Reset Defocus&quot; while this option is on and have that change in 
      focus readout ignored, use the entry in the Focus menu instead of a button in 
      the microscope interface.</p>
    <p>
      <A NAME="hid_specialoptions_normalizealllens"></A><B>Normalize All on Mag Change command (Tasks&nbsp; - Specialized Options submenu)</B></p>
    <p>This option controls when all lenses are normalized after changing 
      magnification on an FEI or Hitachi scope.&nbsp; Normally, the program will 
      always normalize the projector lenses, and normalize condenser and objective 
      lenses in addition when changing between LM and nonLM magnifications.&nbsp; With 
      this option, you can enter a 1 to normalize all lenses after all mag changes 
      within LM, or a 2 to normalize all lenses after all mag changes.</p>
