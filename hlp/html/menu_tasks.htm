      <BR>
       <P><A NAME="hid_eucentricity_coarse"></A><strong>A Note on Tasks in Low Dose Mode</strong></P>
    <P>Tasks that use lower magnification tracking will generally use View images in 
      Low Dose mode, although some have menu entries to control which area is used.&nbsp; 
      However, each such task has a required minimum field of view when run outside of 
      Low Dose, which sets a minimum magnification at which it should be run.&nbsp; When 
      the View magnification is higher than that minimum, and the Search magnification 
      is lower than View and not in LM mode, the program will use Search instead to 
      minimize the risk of excessive shifts between images.</P>
    <P><B>Rough Eucentricity command (Tasks - Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
      <P>This command can be used to adjust the Z height to the eucentric point when the
        Z height might be off by more than 5-10 microns, which can often be the case
        when the specimen rod has just been inserted. This procedure will find
        eucentricity to within about 0.5 micron. This is good enough for tuning the
        microscope but not as accurate as the adjustment provided by the Eucentric -
        Fine command, which should be run before starting a tilt series.</P>
      <P>This procedure does not make any attempt to keep the starting specimen location
        in the field of view.</P>
      <P>The rough eucentricity procedure first switches to a low magnification (or, in
        Low Dose mode, it uses the parameters of the View or Search area, as described 
        above). It takes pictures to
        determine how far the specimen moves laterally upon tilting, starting with a
        very small tilt increment and working up to a total increment of 8 degrees. It
        may adjust the Z height more than once before finishing.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_eucentricity_fine"></A><B>Fine Eucentricity command (Tasks - Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
      <P>This command can be used to adjust the Z height to the eucentric point when it
        is already within 5-10 microns. It is thus a suitable procedure to use if you
        have moved to a new location on the specimen grid since the last time
        eucentricity was adjusted. It is recommended that you run this command before
        starting a tilt series.</P>
      <P>This procedure does not make any attempt to keep the starting specimen location
        in the field of view. It can be run when not at zero tilt, and the program will
        return the stage to your pre-existing tilt at the end.</P>
      <P>The fine eucentricity procedure first switches to a low magnification (or, in
        Low Dose mode, it uses the parameters of the View area or Search area, as 
        described above). It then takes pictures
        at a set of tilts between -24 and +24 degrees. From the image displacements
        during this series, it can compute both the distance in Z from the eucentric
        point and the lateral displacement of the tilt axis from the optical axis. If
        image displacements become too large, the program will adjust Z height then
        repeat the procedure from the beginning.</P>
    <P>For specialized uses it may be desirable to change the maximum angle or tilt
      increment.&nbsp; These parameters can be changed with the properties
      'EucentricityMaxFineAngle' and 'EucentricityFineIntervalAtZero'.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_eucentricity_both"></A><B>Both Rough and Fine command (Tasks - Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to run the rough eucentricity procedure followed immediately by
        the fine eucentricity procedure. This sequence not does make any attempt to keep
        the starting specimen location in the field of view.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_finerealign"></A><B>Refine &amp; Realign command (Tasks - Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to run the fine eucentricity procedure while retaining an item
        of interest centered in the field of view. The program will first take a
        low-magnification reference picture, then do the fine eucentricity procedure,
        then take another picture at the original tilt angle and use that to restore
        the alignment. In Low Dose mode, the reference picture will be taken of the
        View or Search area, as described above. It is not necessary to be at zero tilt to run this command.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_settiltaxisoffset"></A><B>Set Tilt Axis Offset command (Tasks
          - Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set the offset of the tilt axis from the optical axis, which
        is used to keep image shift centered on the optical axis. If the tilt axis is
        more than a micron from the optic axis, it is desirable to set this offset to
        minimize specimen movements in Y and Z during tilting. The offset should be set
        as a system-wide property. However, if this property setting is not adequate,
        or if the offset varies significantly from place to place, this command can be
        used to set the offset. It is placed in this menu because the lateral offset
        from the Refine Eucentricity procedure indicates how much the offset should be
        changed. When the command is selected, a dialog box comes up informing you of
        the current tilt axis offset, and the total offset implied by the lateral
        displacement reported in the last run of
        Refine Eucentricity, if any. The default value in the box is the implied total
        offset (or just the current offset, if Refine Eucentricity has not been run.) A
        tilt axis offset has an effect only if you have selected 'Center image shift on
        tilt axis' in the Image Alignment and Focus control panel.</P>
      <p><A NAME="hid_eucentricity_setoffsetautomatically"></A><B>Set Axis Offset Automatically 
        from Fine command (Tasks- Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
      <P> This command toggles an option to have the tilt axis offset set automatically 
        to the total lateral offset determined from running the fine eucentricity 
        procedure.&nbsp; It will use the same number that appears in the entry box when 
        using the preceding command.</P>
     <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_roughusesearchifinlm"></A>
       <A NAME="hid_eucentricity_eucentricitybyfocus"></A><B>Eucentricity by Focus command (Tasks - Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to set the Z height to the eucentric point with a procedure
      that sets an absolute focus value then measures the defocus and adjusts Z until
      the measured defocus matches the appropriate value.&nbsp; Both the absolute
      focus and the measured defocus are recorded with a calibration procedure run
      from the <a href="hidd_z_by_g_setup.htm">Eucentricity by Focus Setup dialog</a>
      opened by the next menu item.&nbsp; Defocus can be measured with either Focus or
      View images in Low Dose mode, with a desired amount of defocus offset.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_eucentricity_setupeucentricitybyfocus"></A><B>Setup Eucentricity 
        by Focus command (Tasks - Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to open the <a href="hidd_z_by_g_setup.htm">Eucentricity by
      Focus Setup dialog</a> and calibrate the focus targets for the Eucentricity
      by Focus command as well as set a few parameters controlling how it operates.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_setareasinlowdose"></A><B>Set Low Dose Areas command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <p>Use this command to open the&nbsp;
      <A HREF="hidd_task_area_options.htm">Low Dose Area Options for Tasks dialog</A> 
        and select which areas are used for various tasks in Low Dose mode, including 
        Rough and Fine Eucentricity, Reset IS &amp; Realign, and Walkup.</p>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_setintensity"></A><B>Set Intensity command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to change the beam intensity so as to achieve a desired mean
        level in images taken with Record parameters. When you select this command, the
        program first computes the zero-tilt mean (mean of the tilt-foreshortened area)
        of the image in buffer A. It then takes account of the exposure time and
        binning of that image to determine what the zero-tilt mean of a Record image
        would have been at the current beam intensity. The program presents a dialog
        box in which you can enter the new intensity; the default value in this box is
        the computed mean for a Record image at the current intensity. This value will
        give you some idea of how big a change you are requesting. If you accept this
        default, nothing will change. Enter the desired mean level.</P>
      <P>Since the program changes intensity by condensing the beam, it is possible that
        the beam will become too small to cover the camera area. If you increase the
        intensity by a substantial amount, you should check whether the beam still
        covers the area before going on to tasks that rely on full exposures.</P>
      <P>In Low Dose mode, this command will change the intensity setting for the Low Dose
          area from which the image was acquired, regardless of whether &#39;Continuous
          update&#39; is on in the Low Dose control panel.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_set_dose_rate"></A><B>Set Dose Rate command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to change the beam intensity to give a desired dose rate on
      the camera, in electrons per physical pixel per second, based on the counts in
      the image in buffer A.&nbsp; The mean of the tilt-foreshortened area will be
      used, as for the <a href="#hid_process_setintensity">Set Intensity</a> command.&nbsp;
      The programs presents a dialog box showing the dose rate in that image and
      asking for the new value.&nbsp; In Low Dose mode, this command will also change
        the intensity setting for the Low Dose area from which the image was acquired.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_electrondose"></A><B>Electron Dose command (Tasks
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to calibrate electron dose for a particular spot size. This
        calibration is also specific to the probe mode for Thermo/FEI scopes.  It is automatically
        saved in a special short-term calibration file and
        is only good for a limited period of time (1 day by default, but this time can be
        set with the property 'DoseLifetimeInHours'). The calibration requires
        that beam intensity be calibrated and that the SerialEMproperties.txt file
        contain an entry for CountsPerElectron for the camera. </P>
    <P>Before activating
        the command, take an image of the blank beam with a reliable exposure time
        (e.g., 0.2 or more seconds) and with the beam in the calibrated range for the
      current spot size.&nbsp; Specifically, the intensity has to be within the 
      directly calibrated range, not in the range where the calibration can be 
      extrapolated, so the &#39;SPOT&#39; label in the microscope status panel 
      should be darker blue, not light cyan. Select the command and press OK. The program will report
        the dose rate (electrons per square Angstroms per second) of the beam
        intensity at which that image was taken.&nbsp; Or, if intensity was not in the 
      directly calibrated range, there will be a message telling you what that range 
      is.</P>
      <P>The dose calibration will be most accurate if the spot size is normalized (on
        a Thermo/FEI scope). To do this, open the Normalizations panel in the Microscope User
        Interface, select TEM Spotsize, and check Spotsize. Then change spot size to
        get a normalized beam, take a picture, and calibrate the dose with it. By the
        same token, the actual measurement of dose at a particular beam setting will be
        more accurate if the spot size is normalized whenever you change spot sizes.
        Hysteresis in the second condenser lens will also reduce the accuracy of a dose
        measurement, but this is more difficult to control for.</P>
      <P>The dose calibration is specific to the side of beam crossover on which the
        calibration image was taken. Once a calibration is present, the program can
        compute the dose for any image acquisition when beam intensity is within the
        calibrated range, taking into account drift settling time as well as CCD
        exposure time. If relative spot intensities have been calibrated, then a
        calibration at a single spot size will allow dose to be computed at any spot
        size. Note that dose is automatically calibrated when you take a gain
        reference, unless you deselect this option in the <A href="hidd_gainreference.htm">Gain
          Reference dialog</A> .</P>
      <P>When there is an electron dose calibration, the estimated dose at the specimen will be displayed in several
        places:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>
        The dose for a low dose acquisition area will appear in the upper right of the
        Low Dose control panel, with a continuous readout if 'Continuous update' is
        selected.
        <LI>
          The dose for the current camera exposure time, in the lower right of the <A href="hidd_camerasetup.htm">
            Camera Setup dialog</A> .</LI>
        <LI>
          When a direct electron detector is the selected camera, the dose rate at the
          specimen, per unbinned pixel per second, will appear in the Options portion of
          the <a href="hidd_scopestatus.htm">Microscope Status panel</a>.</LI></OL>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_purgeoldcalibs"></A><B>Purge Old Calibs command
          (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>This command will remove any dose calibrations done before the current instance
        of the program was started. You would use this if you do a dose calibration (or
        take a gain reference) and then want to remove any earlier calibrations. Dose
        calibrations older than 24 hours are ignored when the program starts. Also,
        when dose is calibrated, other calibrations older than 12 hours are then
        removed.</P>
      <P><A name="hid_calibration_set_aperture_size"></A><B>Set Aperture Size command
        (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to inform the program of the current size of the C2 aperture
      on a Titan microscope, where the illuminated area read from the microscope and
      used for intensity is scaled by this aperture size when the aperture is changed.&nbsp; 
        The command is disabled if the program determines on startup that it can control 
        the apertures through UTAPI scripting, or if the property 
        &#39;MonitorC2ApertureSize&#39; is set to 2 and aperture control is available otherwise.&nbsp;
      The program will scale the intensity values in the beam intensity, spot
      intensity, and crossover calibrations so that they are valid for this aperture
      size.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the aperture size is set either with this command or&nbsp;after one of those calibrations, it will be remembered between sessions in the
      short term calibration file.&nbsp; If the aperture is changed only through 
        commands from SerialEM, this command should not be needed, because the program 
        will scale the intensities after each C2 aperture change (unless 
        &#39;MonitorC2ApertureSize&#39; is set to 0 to disable this feature).</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_movebeam"></A><B>Move Beam command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to move the beam by a controlled amount. You can use it to
        center the beam by first taking a picture with the beam condensed enough to
        show much of its boundaries. Then click the left mouse button to set a display
        marker point in the center of the beam. Next, select this command, and the
        center of the beam will be moved to the center of the field. In general, the
        beam will be moved by the amount that would move the marker point to the center
        of the field.</P>
      <P>After you use this command, you need to take another picture to see the position
        of the beam.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_centerbeam"></A><B>Center Beam command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>You can use this command to center the beam if the edge of the beam is fairly
        sharp and appears in the currently active image. The program will analyze the
        image to find the beam edge then solve for a circle that fits the edge. It will
        then move the beam to move the center of that circle toward or to the center of
        the image. The solution will be most accurate if the beam edge appears in 3 or
        4 corners of the image, and will be fairly accurate when there is beam edge in
        two corners of the image. With an edge in only one quadrant, the program will
        be increasingly conservative in how much it moves the beam, the smaller the
        piece of edge is. When the edge occupies less than 20 degrees, the beam will
        simply be moved enough to get the edge out of the field, so do not expect the
        beam to be centered in such situations. This command will not work if the beam
        edge is not relatively sharp, so it will not work with some non-FEG scopes.</P>
    <P>If the log says &#39;No beam edges detectable in this image&#39; for an image with
      clear edges, check the counts in the region otside the beam compared to inside
      the beam.&nbsp; The program requires that the counts outside fall below 15% of
      the mean inside.&nbsp; If the background counts outside the beam are too high,
      set the property &#39;FindBeamOutsideFrac&#39; to an appropriate value above 0.15.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_autocenterbeam"></A><B>Autocenter Beam command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>You can use this command to center the beam automatically by taking an image
        with the beam condensed so that its position can be detected reliably either
        from the edges of the beam or from the average location of the beam in the
        image. You must first set up the beam intensity at the current or a nearby
        magnification and spot size, using the <A HREF="hidd_autocensetup.htm">Beam
          Autocenter Setup dialog box</A> . The program will condense the beam, take
        one or two images depending on the centering method, and restore the beam.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_setupautocenter"></A><B>Setup Autocenter command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to open the <A HREF="hidd_autocensetup.htm">Beam Autocenter Setup
          dialog box</A> and set the beam intensity that will be used for
        autocentering.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_walkup"></A><B>Walk Up command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to go from one tilt angle to another while retaining an item of
        interest centered in the field of view. Typically this would be used to go from
        zero tilt to a high tilt angle. After you select the command, you will
        encounter a dialog box in which to enter the destination tilt angle. This
        destination angle will be saved and will appear as the default angle the next
        time you invoke the command.</P>
      <P>This procedure involves taking alignment pictures at a series of tilt angles,
        with a tilt interval that is quite coarse at low angles and finer at high
        angles. Image shift will be reset whenever it gets too high, but no
        autofocusing is done. The pictures are taken with the Trial parameter set and,
        if in Low Dose mode, the pictures are of the Trial area. If the magnification
        is too high for reliable tracking, the pictures will be taken at a lower
        magnification.</P>
      <P>If you choose a destination angle that is in the opposite direction from the
        last direction of tilt, the routine will run the Reverse Tilt procedure first
        to avoid losing the area of interest.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_walkupanchor"></A><B>Walk Up &amp; Anchor command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to do the same operation as in the Walk Up command but also
        leave an image behind at a specified intermediate tilt angle. The image will be
        left in the last image buffer and can be used as an 'anchor' for alignment
        during a tilt series. The angle for the anchor image will be saved as the
        default for the next use of this command and is the same as the angle that
        appears for an anchor image in the <A HREF="hidd_tiltseries.htm">Tilt Series Setup
          dialog box</A> .</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_use_view_in_lowdose"></A><B>Use View in LD command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to select whether the Walk Up routine will be run with the
        View or Search area (as described above) instead of the Trial area when in Low Dose mode.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_setincrements"></A><B>Set Increments command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set the minimum and maximum tilt increments for the Walk Up
        operation. The maximum increment is used at zero tilt, and the increment at any
        tilt angle is either this maximum times the cosine of the angle, or the minimum
        increment, whichever is greater. In STEM mode, you can also set the tilt
        interval between autofocusing during a Walk Up.&nbsp; Your settings for these values are retained
        between sessions of SerialEM.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_setupcooker"></A><B>Setup Cooker command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to open the <A HREF="hidd_cooksetup.htm">Specimen Cooking Setup
          dialog box</A> and set the magnification, spot size, and intensity to use
        for pre-exposing the specimen.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_cookspecimen"></A><B>Cook Specimen command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to pre-expose the specimen for the desired electron dose or
        time, using the parameters set in the <A HREF="hidd_cooksetup.htm">Specimen Cooking
          Setup dialog box</A> . The program will lower the screen to expose the
        specimen, report in the log window as each tenth of the exposure is finished,
        and continually update the status bar with the expected time remaining.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_assessanglerange"></A><B>Assess Angle Range command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to acquire a small series of images at high tilt in order to
        determine the limits of the tilt range for a tilt series. There are options
        that allow a series to be acquired as quickly as possible, or more slowly and
        carefully, depending on what you wish to see in the high tilt images. These
        options are set in the <A HREF="hidd_tsrange.htm">Tilt Series Range Finder
          dialog box</A>.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_assess_interset_shifts"></A><B>Assess Interset Shifts command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>In STEM mode, use this command to measure the shifts between Record and other
        images with current camera parameters.&nbsp; These shifts are compensated during
        tilt series acquisition to make sure that tracking and focusing images are
        centered on the Record area.&nbsp; The shifts are specific to the magnification
        and the image size and binning, and also depend on exposure time when the scan
        rate is relatively high.&nbsp; The shifts are not saved for different
        conditions, so this command needs to be run as part of the routine tasks before
        starting a tilt series, after camera parameters have been set up.&nbsp; The
        Record exposure time can be varied during the tilt series, but the other
        exposure times should be kept constant, or else the shifts will not be
        considered valid.</P>
    <P>When not in Low Dose mode, the routine will measure the shift for a Trial image
      and for a Focus image relative to Record.&nbsp; When in Low Dose mode, the
      routine will always measure a shift for a Preview image.&nbsp; It will then
      measure a shift for a Trial if Trial area is centered on Record, and a shift for
      Focus if the Focus area is centered on Record.&nbsp; At the end, you should
      scroll through the images to make sure they are well-enough aligned.&nbsp; If
      the image in A is not aligned, you can align it with the right mouse button then
      use the <A HREF="#hid_tasks_revise_cancel">Revise/Cancel Shifts
          command</A>.&nbsp; If a different image is not aligned, you can try the command again
      with a new image area, or eliminate the shifts with the <A HREF="#hid_tasks_revise_cancel">Revise/Cancel Shifts
          command</A>.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_revise_cancel"></A><B>Revise/Cancel Shifts command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command either to indicate that an interset shift should be taken from
        the alignment of the image in buffer A, or to eliminate the last measured
        interset shifts.&nbsp; You will first be asked if you want the revise a shift
        based on the alignment of the image in A.&nbsp; If you answer No, you will then
        be asked if you want to eliminate the interset shifts.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_reset_realign"></A><B>Reset IS &amp; Realign command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to reset the microscope image shift (IS) while retaining an
         item of interest centered in the field of view. The program will take a
         reference picture, reset the image shift to zero and move the stage to
         compensate, then take another picture and align it to the reference picture. At
         the end, image shift will no longer be zero because of this alignment; in fact,
         it can be as much as one-quarter of the original image shift because of
        inaccuracy in stage movement. The reference picture will be taken at low
        magnification or, if in Low Dose mode, with the View or Search parameters, as 
        described above.</P>
      <P>If you just want to reset image shift without having a feature stay centered,
        use the Reset Shifts button in the <A HREF="hidd_alignfocus.htm">Image Alignment
          &amp; Focus panel</A> .</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_setiterationlimit"></A><B>Set Iteration Limit command (Tasks
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to change the criterion that the Reset IS &amp; Realign
        procedure uses to decide whether to reset the shift and realign a second time.
        After resetting the shift, the program takes an image and aligns it to image
        taken before the reset. If image shift is still greater than this criterion, it
        will be reset again, and another image taken and aligned.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_usetrialinld"></A><A NAME="hid_tasks_setupvppconditioning"></A><B>Setup VPP Conditioning command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to open the <A HREF="hidd_vpp_expose_setup.htm">Phase Plate Conditioning Setup
          dialog box</A> and set parameters for conditioning a Volta phase plate. The dialog allows one to
        start the conditioning operation, which can also be run with the

      <P>Use this command to open the <A HREF="hidd_driftwaitsetup.htm">Wait for Drift Setup
          dialog box</A> and set parameters for the Wait for Drift task, which can be
        run from tilt series and with the script command DriftWaitTask to measure drift
        and wait until it reaches a selected level.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_reverse_tilt"></A><B>Reverse Tilt command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to reverse the direction of tilting while retaining an item of
        interest centered in the field of view. For example, if you tilt up to a high
        angle, center your item of interest, then try to start a tilt series by just
        tilting back down, the specimen may move considerably because of backlash in
        the stage. This problem can be avoided by using this command. The program will
        take a reference picture, tilt far enough in the current direction to work out
        the backlash, tilt back to the starting angle, then take another picture and
        align it to the reference picture. The reference picture will be taken at low
        magnification or, if in Low Dose mode, with the View or Search parameters, as 
        described above.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_setupscopemanagement"></A><B>Setup Scope Management command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <p>Use this command to open the <a href="hidd_manage_dewars.htm">Dewar and Vacuum
        Management</a> dialog, which allows you to set parameters for a routine
        that can manage periodic operations on the microscope that might interfere with
        data collection, either vacuum pumps running on a Thermo/FEI scope, or nitrogen dewar
        filling on various scopes.&nbsp; The routine can check whether some events have
        begun and wait until they are done, or start some events proactively and wait
        until completion.</p>
