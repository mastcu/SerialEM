       <P><A NAME="hid_eucentricity_coarse"></A><B>Rough Eucentricity command (Tasks - Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
      <P>This command can be used to adjust the Z height to the eucentric point when the
        Z height might be off by more than 5-10 microns, which can often be the case
        when the specimen rod has just been inserted. This procedure will find
        eucentricity to within about 0.5 micron. This is good enough for tuning the
        microscope but not as accurate as the adjustment provided by the Eucentric -
        Fine command, which should be run before starting a tilt series.</P>
      <P>This procedure does not make any attempt to keep the starting specimen location
        in the field of view.</P>
      <P>The rough eucentricity procedure first switches to a low magnification (or, in
        low dose mode, it uses the parameters of the View area). It takes pictures to
        determine how far the specimen moves laterally upon tilting, starting with a
        very small tilt increment and working up to a total increment of 8 degrees. It
        may adjust the Z height more than once before finishing.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_eucentricity_fine"></A><B>Fine Eucentricity command (Tasks - Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
      <P>This command can be used to adjust the Z height to the eucentric point when it
        is already within 5-10 microns. It is thus a suitable procedure to use if you
        have moved to a new location on the specimen grid since the last time
        eucentricity was adjusted. It is recommended that you run this command before
        starting a tilt series.</P>
      <P>This procedure does not make any attempt to keep the starting specimen location
        in the field of view. It can be run when not at zero tilt, and the program will
        return the stage to your pre-existing tilt at the end.</P>
      <P>The fine eucentricity procedure first switches to a low magnification (or, in
        low dose mode, it uses the parameters of the View area). It then takes pictures
        at a set of tilts between -24 and +24 degrees. From the image displacements
        during this series, it can compute both the distance in Z from the eucentric
        point and the lateral displacement of the tilt axis from the optical axis. If
        image displacements become too large, the program will adjust Z height then
        repeat the procedure from the beginning.</P>
    <P>For specialized uses it may be desirable to change the maximum angle or tilt
      increment.&nbsp; These parameters can be changed with the properties
      'EucentricityMaxFineAngle' and 'EucentricityFineIntervalAtZero'.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_eucentricity_both"></A><B>Both Rough and Fine command (Tasks - Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to run the rough eucentricity procedure followed immediately by
        the fine eucentricity procedure. This sequence does make any attempt to keep
        the starting specimen location in the field of view.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_finerealign"></A><B>Refine &amp; Realign command (Tasks - Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to run the fine eucentricity procedure while retaining an item
        of interest centered in the field of view. The program will first take a
        low-magnification reference picture, then do the fine eucentricity procedure,
        then take another picture at the original tilt angle and use that to restore
        the alignment. In low dose mode, the reference picture will be taken of the
        View area. It is not necessary to be at zero tilt to run this command.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_settiltaxisoffset"></A><B>Set Tilt Axis Offset command (Tasks
          - Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set the offset of the tilt axis from the optical axis, which
        is used to keep image shift centered on the optical axis. If the tilt axis is
        more than a micron from the optic axis, it is desirable to set this offset to
        minimize specimen movements in Y and Z during tilting. The offset should be set
        as a system-wide property. However, if this property setting is not adequate,
        or if the offset varies significantly from place to place, this command can be
        used to set the offset. It is placed in this menu because the lateral offset
        from the Refine Eucentricity procedure indicates how much the offset should be
        changed. When the command is selected, a dialog box comes up informing you of
        the current tilt axis offset, and the total offset implied by the lateral
        displacement reported in the last run of
        Refine Eucentricity, if any. The default value in the box is the implied total
        offset (or just the current offset, if Refine Eucentricity has not been run.) A
        tilt axis offset has an effect only if you have selected 'Center image shift on
        tilt axis' in the Image Alignment and Focus control panel.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_trial_in_ld_refine"></A><B>Use Trial in LD Refine command (Tasks
          - Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to select whether the Trial area rather than the View area will
        be used for the tilted images that are taken when refining eucentricity. The
        View area will still be used for the initial and final tracking images when the
        Refine and Realign procedure is used, and for the rough eucentricity procedure
        when both rough and fine procedures are run together. Using the Trial area will
        save a little dose but will reduce the range of Z heights over which the
        procedure can run reliably. Also, if the specimen is not relatively flat along
        the tilt axis, the Trial area rather than the Record area will be brought to
        the eucentric height.</P>
     <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_roughusesearchifinlm"></A><B>Rough Use Search if in LM command (Tasks - Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
      <P>Toggle this entry to switch between using the View area for the rough
        eucentricity procedure in Low Dose mode and using the Search area, if it is
        defined as being in low magnification <em>and</em> if the microscope is already
        in low magnification.&nbsp; Running this procedure in LM may be accurate enough
        for some purposes, so this option allows it to be run with the Search area
        without losing the time involved in leaving low magnification just for this
        purpose.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_eucentricity_eucentricitybyfocus"></A><B>Eucentricity by Focus command (Tasks - Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to set the Z height to the eucentric point with a procedure
      that sets an absolute focus value then measures the defocus and adjusts Z until
      the measured defocus matches the appropriate value.&nbsp; Both the absolute
      focus and the measured defocus are recorded with a calibration procedure run
      from the <a href="hidd_z_by_g_setup.htm">Eucentricity by Focus Setup dialog</a>
      opened by the next menu item.&nbsp; Defocus can be measured with either Focus or
      View images in Low Dose mode, with a desired amount of defocus offset.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_eucentricity_setupeucentricitybyfocus"></A><B>Calibrate Focus Targets command (Tasks - Eucentricity submenu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to open the <a href="hidd_z_by_g_setup.htm">Eucentricity by
      Focus Setup dialog</a> and calibrate the focus targets for the Eucentricity
      by Focus command as well as set a few parameters controlling how it operates.</P>
     <P><A NAME="hid_process_setintensity"></A><B>Set Intensity command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to change the beam intensity so as to achieve a desired mean
        level in images taken with Record parameters. When you select this command, the
        program first computes the zero-tilt mean (mean of the tilt-foreshortened area)
        of the image in buffer A. It then takes account of the exposure time and
        binning of that image to determine what the zero-tilt mean of a Record image
        would have been at the current beam intensity. The program presents a dialog
        box in which you can enter the new intensity; the default value in this box is
        the computed mean for a Record image at the current intensity. This value will
        give you some idea of how big a change you are requesting. If you accept this
        default, nothing will change. Enter the desired mean level.</P>
      <P>Since the program changes intensity by condensing the beam, it is possible that
        the beam will become too small to cover the camera area. If you increase the
        intensity by a substantial amount, you should check whether the beam still
        covers the area before going on to tasks that rely on full exposures.</P>
      <P>In Low Dose mode, this command will change the intensity setting for the Low Dose
          area from which the image was acquired, regardless of whether &#39;Continuous
          update&#39; is on in the Low Dose control panel.</P>
    <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_set_dose_rate"></A><B>Set Dose Rate command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
    <P>Use this command to change the beam intensity to give a desired dose rate on
      the camera, in electrons per unbinned pixel per second, based on the counts in
      the image in buffer A.&nbsp; The mean of the tilt-foreshortened area will be
      used, as for the <a href="#hid_process_setintensity">Set Intensity</a> command.&nbsp;
      The programs presents a dialog box showing the dose rate in that image and
      asking for the new value.&nbsp; In Low Dose mode, this command will also change
        the intensity setting for the Low Dose area from which the image was acquired.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_process_movebeam"></A><B>Move Beam command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to move the beam by a controlled amount. You can use it to
        center the beam by first taking a picture with the beam condensed enough to
        show much of its boundaries. Then click the left mouse button to set a display
        marker point in the center of the beam. Next, select this command, and the
        center of the beam will be moved to the center of the field. In general, the
        beam will be moved by the amount that would move the marker point to the center
        of the field.</P>
      <P>After you use this command, you need to take another picture to see the position
        of the beam.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_centerbeam"></A><B>Center Beam command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>You can use this command to center the beam if the edge of the beam is fairly
        sharp and appears in the currently active image. The program will analyze the
        image to find the beam edge then solve for a circle that fits the edge. It will
        then move the beam to move the center of that circle toward or to the center of
        the image. The solution will be most accurate if the beam edge appears in 3 or
        4 corners of the image, and will be fairly accurate when there is beam edge in
        two corners of the image. With an edge in only one quadrant, the program will
        be increasingly conservative in how much it moves the beam, the smaller the
        piece of edge is. When the edge occupies less than 20 degrees, the beam will
        simply be moved enough to get the edge out of the field, so do not expect the
        beam to be centered in such situations. This command will not work if the beam
        edge is not relatively sharp, so it will not work with some non-FEG scopes.</P>
    <P>If the log says &#39;No beam edges detectable in this image&#39; for an image with
      clear edges, check the counts in the region otside the beam compared to inside
      the beam.&nbsp; The program requires that the counts outside fall below 15% of
      the mean inside.&nbsp; If the background counts outside the beam are too high,
      set the property &#39;FindBeamOutsideFrac&#39; to an appropriate value above 0.15.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_autocenterbeam"></A><B>Autocenter Beam command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>You can use this command to center the beam automatically by taking an image
        with the beam condensed so that its position can be detected reliably either
        from the edges of the beam or from the average location of the beam in the
        image. You must first set up the beam intensity at the current or a nearby
        magnification and spot size, using the <A HREF="hidd_autocensetup.htm">Beam
          Autocenter Setup dialog box</A> . The program will condense the beam, take
        one or two images depending on the centering method, and restore the beam.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_setupautocenter"></A><B>Setup Autocenter command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to open the <A HREF="hidd_autocensetup.htm">Beam Autocenter Setup
          dialog box</A> and set the beam intensity that will be used for
        autocentering.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_walkup"></A><B>Walk Up command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to go from one tilt angle to another while retaining an item of
        interest centered in the field of view. Typically this would be used to go from
        zero tilt to a high tilt angle. After you select the command, you will
        encounter a dialog box in which to enter the destination tilt angle. This
        destination angle will be saved and will appear as the default angle the next
        time you invoke the command.</P>
      <P>This procedure involves taking alignment pictures at a series of tilt angles,
        with a tilt interval that is quite coarse at low angles and finer at high
        angles. Image shift will be reset whenever it gets too high, but no
        autofocusing is done. The pictures are taken with the Trial parameter set and,
        if in low dose mode, the pictures are of the Trial area. If the magnification
        is too high for reliable tracking, the pictures will be taken at a lower
        magnification.</P>
      <P>If you choose a destination angle that is in the opposite direction from the
        last direction of tilt, the routine will run the Reverse Tilt procedure first
        to avoid losing the area of interest.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_walkupanchor"></A><B>Walk Up &amp; Anchor command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to do the same operation as in the Walk Up command but also
        leave an image behind at a specified intermediate tilt angle. The image will be
        left in the last image buffer and can be used as an 'anchor' for alignment
        during a tilt series. The angle for the anchor image will be saved as the
        default for the next use of this command and is the same as the angle that
        appears for an anchor image in the <A HREF="hidd_tiltseries.htm">Tilt Series Setup
          dialog box</A> .</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_use_view_in_lowdose"></A><B>Use View in LD command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to select whether the Walk Up routine will be run with the
        View area when in Low Dose mode.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_setincrements"></A><B>Set Increments command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to set the minimum and maximum tilt increments for the Walk Up
        operation. The maximum increment is used at zero tilt, and the increment at any
        tilt angle is either this maximum times the cosine of the angle, or the minimum
        increment, whichever is greater. In STEM mode, you can also set the tilt
        interval between autofocusing during a Walk Up.&nbsp; Your settings for these values are retained
        between sessions of SerialEM.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_setupcooker"></A><B>Setup Cooker command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to open the <A HREF="hidd_cooksetup.htm">Specimen Cooking Setup

        for pre-exposing the specimen.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_cookspecimen"></A><B>Cook Specimen command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to pre-expose the specimen for the desired electron dose or
        time, using the parameters set in the <A HREF="hidd_cooksetup.htm">Specimen Cooking
          Setup dialog box</A> . The program will lower the screen to expose the
        specimen, report in the log window as each tenth of the exposure is finished,
        and continually update the status bar with the expected time remaining.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_assessanglerange"></A><B>Assess Angle Range command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to acquire a small series of images at high tilt in order to
        determine the limits of the tilt range for a tilt series. There are options
        that allow a series to be acquired as quickly as possible, or more slowly and
        carefully, depending on what you wish to see in the high tilt images. These
        options are set in the <A HREF="hidd_tsrange.htm">Tilt Series Range Finder
          dialog box</A>.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_assess_interset_shifts"></A><B>Assess Interset Shifts command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>In STEM mode, use this command to measure the shifts between Record and other
        images with current camera parameters.&nbsp; These shifts are compensated during
        tilt series acquisition to make sure that tracking and focusing images are
        centered on the Record area.&nbsp; The shifts are specific to the magnification
        and the image size and binning, and also depend on exposure time when the scan
        rate is relatively high.&nbsp; The shifts are not saved for different
        conditions, so this command needs to be run as part of the routine tasks before
        starting a tilt series, after camera parameters have been set up.&nbsp; The
        Record exposure time can be varied during the tilt series, but the other
        exposure times should be kept constant, or else the shifts will not be
        considered valid.</P>
    <P>When not in Low Dose mode, the routine will measure the shift for a Trial image
      and for a Focus image relative to Record.&nbsp; When in Low Dose mode, the
      routine will always measure a shift for a Preview image.&nbsp; It will then
      measure a shift for a Trial if Trial area is centered on Record, and a shift for
      Focus if the Focus area is centered on Record.&nbsp; At the end, you should
      scroll through the images to make sure they are well-enough aligned.&nbsp; If
      the image in A is not aligned, you can align it with the right mouse button then
      use the <A HREF="#hid_tasks_revise_cancel">Revise/Cancel Shifts
          command</A>.&nbsp; If a different image is not aligned, you can try the command again
      with a new image area, or eliminate the shifts with the <A HREF="#hid_tasks_revise_cancel">Revise/Cancel Shifts
          command</A>.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_revise_cancel"></A><B>Revise/Cancel Shifts command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command either to indicate that an interset shift should be taken from
        the alignment of the image in buffer A, or to eliminate the last measured
        interset shifts.&nbsp; You will first be asked if you want the revise a shift
        based on the alignment of the image in A.&nbsp; If you answer No, you will then
        be asked if you want to eliminate the interset shifts.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_reset_realign"></A><B>Reset IS &amp; Realign command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to reset the microscope image shift (IS) while retaining an
         item of interest centered in the field of view. The program will take a
         reference picture, reset the image shift to zero and move the stage to
         compensate, then take another picture and align it to the reference picture. At
         the end, image shift will no longer be zero because of this alignment; in fact,
         it can be as much as one-quarter of the original image shift because of
        inaccuracy in stage movement. The reference picture will be taken at low
        magnification or, if in low dose mode, with the View parameters.</P>
      <P>If you just want to reset image shift without having a feature stay centered,
        use the Reset Shifts button in the <A HREF="hidd_alignfocus.htm">Image Alignment
          &amp; Focus panel</A> .</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_setiterationlimit"></A><B>Set Iteration Limit command (Tasks
          menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to change the criterion that the Reset IS &amp; Realign
        procedure uses to decide whether to reset the shift and realign a second time.
        After resetting the shift, the program takes an image and aligns it to image
        taken before the reset. If image shift is still greater than this criterion, it
        will be reset again, and another image taken and aligned.</P>
      <P><A NAME="hid_tasks_usetrialinld"></A><B>Use Trial in LD command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Toggle this entry to switch between using the View and Trial areas for the Reset
        IS &amp; Realign procedure. The View area is the default because the stage
        movement involved in resetting the shift is unpredictable, and the larger field
        of view of the View area is assumed to be needed to do the reset reliably. It
        may be safe to use the trial area if your limit for resetting image shift is
        small (~1 micron), if the field of view of the trial area is fairly large (2
        microns), and if your stage is adjusted so that stage movements are reliable at
        high tilt for the holder being used.</P>

          dialog box</A> and set parameters for conditioning a Volta phase plate. The dialog allows one to
        start the conditioning operation, which can also be run with the

      <P><A NAME="hid_reverse_tilt"></A><B>Reverse Tilt command (Tasks menu)</B></P>
      <P>Use this command to reverse the direction of tilting while retaining an item of
        interest centered in the field of view. For example, if you tilt up to a high
        angle, center your item of interest, then try to start a tilt series by just
        tilting back down, the specimen may move considerably because of backlash in
        the stage. This problem can be avoided by using this command. The program will
        take a reference picture, tilt far enough in the current direction to work out
        the backlash, tilt back to the starting angle, then take another picture and
        align it to the reference picture. The reference picture will be taken at low
        magnification or, if in low dose mode, with the View parameters.</P>

      <P><A NAME="hid_special_piezo_for_ld_axis_shift"></A><B>Piezo for LD Axis Shift
        command (Tasks&nbsp; - Specialized Options submenu)</B></P>
    <p>
      If there is a piezo plugin loaded that can provide stage movement along the tilt
      axis, and the properties file contains both an entry 'UsePiezoForLDAxis'
      specifying this piezo and an entry 'PiezoScale' defining the range and scaling
      of this piezo, this option can be turned on to use this piezo movement as a
      substitute for on-axis image shift between Record/View and Trial/Focus areas in
      Low Dose mode.&nbsp; The option can be toggled only when Low Dose mode is off.&nbsp;
      When Low Dose is turned on with this option enabled, the piezo is moved to the
      end of its range appropriate for the Record area.&nbsp; Several restrictions are
      also enforced: Focus and Trial are constrained to the same properties; 'Balance
      Shifts' is turned off; rotation of the interarea axis away from the tilt axis is
      turned off.&nbsp; The 'Position on tilt axis' entry can be negative or positive
      as needed, but the stage will be moved to the other end of its range when the
      sign is changed.</p>

      Even when 'Trim dark borders in Autoalign' is not selected in the
      <a href="hidd_alignfocus.htm">Image
      Alignment &amp; Focus</a> control panel, this trimming happens automatically in three
      cases: when in Low Dose mode, when doing a task at a lower magnification and not
      in Low Dose mode, and
      in the first round of Realign to Item or alignments after resetting image shift 
      in Align to Template.&nbsp; This option allows the automatic
      trimming to be disabled in selected cases.&nbsp; Three dialog boxes will come
      up.&nbsp; The first controls the trimming in Low Dose mode; enter 1 if you want
      to disable it just when doing a tilt series, or 2 if you want to disable it
      always.&nbsp; The second entry controls the trimming when doing tasks; again,
      enter 1 if you want to disable it just when doing a tilt series, or 2 if you
      want to disable it always.&nbsp; The third entry allows you to disable the
      trimming when running Realign to Item or Align to Template.&nbsp; Note that the &#39;AlignTo&#39; script
      command also has an optional entry to prevent trimming.&nbsp; The decision to
      trim is made as follows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trimming is not done if &#39;AlignTo&#39; is run with that option set to prevent
        trimming</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if doing Realign to Item or Align to Template, trimming is 
        determined by the option set here for those operations</li>
      <li>Or, if in low mag for another task and not in Low Dose, trimming is determined
        by the option set here for tasks</li>
      <li>Or if in Low Dose mode, not doing a Realign or&nbsp; Template Align, trimming is determined by the
        option set here for Low Dose</li>
      <li>If not in Low Dose mode or doing Realign or Template Align or a task, trimming is controlled by

      <A NAME="hid_specialoptions_allowcontinuousintasks"></A><B>Allow Continuous in TS command (Tasks&nbsp; - Specialized Options submenu)</B></p>
    <p>
      Ordinarily, the program will acquire images in single-frame mode for almost all
      automated operations, even when using a camera parameter set that has continuous
      mode set.&nbsp; If this option is selected, images acquired directly by the Tilt
      Series Controller will be allowed to be taken in continuous mode if that mode is
      set in the camera parameters.&nbsp; Such continuous acquisitions must be stopped
      manually by the user before the tilt series can go on.&nbsp; This exception does
      not apply to images taken when autofocusing or doing other tasks; all tasks
      enforce single-frame mode.&nbsp; Thus, it applies to Trial and Record, as well
      as to View and Preview images taken in Low Dose mode.</p>
    <p>
      <A NAME="hid_specialoptions_normalizeviaviewforau"></A><B>Normalize Via View
      for Autofocus command (Tasks&nbsp; - Specialized Options submenu)</B></p>
    <p>
      When this option is selected, the program will switch to the View area in Low
      Dose before going to the Focus area for autofocusing, unless it is currently in
      Focus and arrived there from View.&nbsp; When &#39;Keep Focus and Trial identical&#39;
      is selected in the Low Dose Control Panel, Trial and Focus are considered
      equivalent for the purpose of deciding whether this normalization needs to be
      done.</p>
    <p>
      <A NAME="hid_specialoptions_adjustfocusonprobemodechange"></A><B>Adjust Focus on Probe Mode Change command (Tasks&nbsp; - Special Option submenu)</B></p>
    <p>
      When changing between microprobe and nanoprobe TEM modes on Thermo/FEI scopes, the
      scope will restore the defocus last seen in a mode when returning to that mode.&nbsp;
      With this option turned on, the program will try to maintain a constant
      difference between the focus levels in the two modes. It does this by tracking
      how much defocus changes during the time spent in one mode and imposing that
      focus change on the scope's restored focus value when switching to the other
      mode.&nbsp; This means that you can use autofocus in one mode and have the
      required focus change applied when returning to the other mode.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>
      The option needs to be turned off in order to impose a needed focus difference
      between the modes.&nbsp; As of SerialEM 3.7, focus differences are always
      applied in Low Dose mode only when this option is on. </p>
    <p>
      If you want to &quot;Reset Defocus&quot; while this option is on and have that change in
      focus readout ignored, use the entry in the Focus menu instead of a button in
      the microscope interface.</p>

      always normalize the projector lenses, and normalize condenser and objective
      lenses in addition when changing between LM and nonLM magnifications.&nbsp; With
      this option, you can enter a 1 to normalize all lenses after all mag changes
      within LM, or a 2 to normalize all lenses after all mag changes.</p>

     <A NAME="hid_specializedoptions_skipblankinginldwithscreenup"></A><B>Skip Blanking in LD when Screen Up command (Tasks&nbsp; - Specialized Options submenu)</B></p>
     <p> This option controls whether the beam is kept blanked except when acquiring images when the
       screen is up in Low Dose mode.
       &nbsp; This blanking protects the specimen from being exposed when there is no camera
       inserted that would cause shuttering to keep the beam blanked.  When there is a camera inserted,
        it also protects the specimen when the screen is lowered during the interval between the
       camera opening its shutter and SerialEM discovering that the screen is down.&nbsp; Select this option to
       prevent the blanking if it is problematic for some reason.
