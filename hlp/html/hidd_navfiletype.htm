        Dialog</span></p>
    <p>This dialog lets you set the properties of a file to open for a Navigator item 
      to be acquired.</p>

    <p><strong>Open file for</strong>:</p>
    <p>Select <strong>Single frame images</strong> to open a file for single images, 
      or <strong>Montaged images</strong> to open a file for a montage, in which case 
      the <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup dialog box</A> will open next.</p>
    <p><strong>Fit montage to polygon</strong></p>
    <p>If the Navigator item in a polygon and you have selected to open a montage, 
      this option can be selected to fit the montage to the polygon.&nbsp; Number of 
      pieces, frame sizes, and overlaps will be adjusted to acquire just the area 
      needed to cover the polygon, and pieces fully outside the polygon will be 
      skipped.</p>
    <p><strong>Skip montage setup dialog when fitting in future</strong></p>
    <p>If you are fitting montages to polygons, select this option to avoid having 
      both this dialog and the <A HREF="hidd_montagesetup.htm">Montage Setup dialog </A> 
      open when you select <strong>New file at item</strong> in the Navigator for 
      other polygons.&nbsp; You can still use the <strong>File Props</strong> button 
      there to open these dialogs.</p>
    <p><strong>Montage reusability</strong></p>
    <p>Ordinarily, when a new file is opened during Navigator acquisition, a 
      previously opened file will be closed.&nbsp; The choices here represent a 
      mechanism for leaving montage files open and reusing them for montages where the 
      polygon would require the same number of pieces, with the same piece size and 
      overlap.&nbsp; (The location and number of skipped pieces can differ.)&nbsp; The 
      goal is to reduce the number of files that need to be managed when acquiring 
      montages as many polygons.&nbsp; The setup of files using this mechanism is 
      handled automatically when new files are set to be opened for a whole collection 
      of polygons at once, using Shift-N at both ends of the range of polygons in the 
      Navigator.&nbsp; In that case, the program fits montages independently to each 
      polygon.&nbsp; With all those montage parameters available, it then analyzes 
      each set of montages with the same number of pieces, determining a piece size 
      and overlap that will cover all of them.&nbsp; It assigns those size and overlap 
      values to all matching montages where the extra area being acquired by taking a 
      larger area does not exceed a certain fraction of the overall area, where the 
      file would be opened for the first such montage and left open, and used for the 
      later montages.&nbsp; That fraction is set by the property &#39;MaxMontReuseWaste&#39; 
      and has a default of 0.2.&nbsp; The process is repeated until all montages are 
      handled.</p>
    <p>The choices here are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Close file when next new file is to be opened</strong> - the normal 
        behavior with no file reuse</li>
      <li><strong>Leave file open for reuse; close matching montage</strong> - A new 
        file will be opened unconditionally for this item and left open when the next 
        file is opened.&nbsp; Rather than closing the last opened file, a previously 
        left-open montage with matching settings will be closed if one exists.&nbsp; 
        This practice prevents an unlimited number of files being left open.&nbsp; Items 
        with this setting will show acquisition codes of AL instead of AF.</li>
      <li><strong>Open file only if needed; leave open for reuse</strong> - A new file 
        will be opened only if there is no previous left-open montage with matching 
        settings to use instead.&nbsp; The new file will in turn be left open for reuse.&nbsp; 
        Items with this setting will show acquisition codes of AO instead of AF.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Just change reusability without refitting montage</strong></p>
    <p>This option is available in case you do fitting to a large number of polygons 
      and wish to split the montages into more files than the minimum number that the 
      program came up with.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without this option, if you open this dialog 
      for an item where you want to start a new file, change the setting from <strong>
      Open only if needed</strong> to <strong>Leave file open for reuse</strong>, and 
      press <strong>OK</strong>, it will go on to the montage setup dialog and refit 
      the polygon, almost certainly giving it a size that is not suitable for reuse.&nbsp; 
      With this option checked, pressing <strong>OK</strong> causes the new setting to 
      be stored and no other changes to occur.</p>
