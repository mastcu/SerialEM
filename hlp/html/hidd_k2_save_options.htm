    <p>
      This dialog has two sections.&nbsp; The upper section presents choices about the files produced when the SerialEM plugin 
      to DigitalMicrograph saves subframes for a Dose Fractionation exposure.&nbsp; 
      Everything except one option in this section appears only for Gatan cameras 
      (mostly just for K2/K3).&nbsp; The lower section, which appears for all cameras 
      that can save frames, allows you to 
      control the name of these files.&nbsp; Except for Direct Electron cameras with 
      an older server version, you can also put subsets of the 
      files into different 
      folders automatically.&nbsp; These are global settings that apply to all camera parameter sets in which 
      frames are saved.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Save metadata (.mdoc) file for each frame stack</b></p>
    <p>
      Select this option to have a metadata file in the autodoc format, with extension 
      &#39;.mdoc&#39;, saved along with each set of frames.&nbsp; The file will be named with 
      &#39;.mdoc&#39; appended to a frame stack name or to the name of the folder containing 
      single-frame files.&nbsp; This file will have the same format as the file opened 
      with <a href="menu_file.htm#hid_file_open_mdoc">Open .mdoc for Frames</a> in the 
      file menu, namely the one section in the file will be named &#39;Frameset&#39;.&nbsp; 
      For a&nbsp; K2/K3, it will also have the gain reference and defect file names if frames are taken 
      without normalization.&nbsp; Additional entries can be added to the file with 
      the script commands &#39;StartNextFrameStackMdoc&#39; and &#39;AddToNextFrameStackMdoc&#39;, but 
      these commands must be given before acquisition.</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Other Gatan Camera Options</b></i></p>
    <p>
      <b>File type</b></p>
    <p>
      The choices here are files in MRC format, TIFF files with LZW compression, and 
      TIFF files with ZIP compression.&nbsp; Both compressions are loss-less and can 
      be read by programs in IMOD that read TIFF files.&nbsp; LZW is more effective, 
      and much faster, than ZIP compression for unnormalized K2/K3 images.&nbsp; ZIP 
      compresses normalized images more, but may be considerably slower.&nbsp;Compression 
      is parallelized, so ZIP compression may still take a reasonable amount of time. If you are saving normalized or 
      K2/K3 linear mode images, you should assess both 
      the compression factor and the acquisition time with the typical images for a 
      project when deciding which form to use on a routine basis.&nbsp; The best way 
      to assess acquisition time is to turn on Debug Mode in the Camera menu.&nbsp; 
      With this on, the SerialEM log will show the total elapsed time for acquiring 
      each image.&nbsp; Also, when frame-saving is complete, the Results window in DM 
      will show a line reporting the time required to process and save all of the 
      frames.&nbsp; Compression occurs as part of saving, so the saving time is the 
      one that will change with these different options. </p>
    <p>
      <b>Use extension .mrcs</b></p>
    <p>
      When MRC output format is selected, this option can be used to make the names of 
      the frame stacks end in &#39;.mrcs&#39; instead of &#39;.mrc&#39;.&nbsp; Some other software 
      requires the &#39;.mrcs&#39; extension to process frame stacks.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Save one frame per file</b></p>
    <p>
      Select this option to have each saved subframe written as a separate file 
      instead of having all subframes for an acquisition written to one image stack.&nbsp; 
      They will be written in a uniquely named folder.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Save frames without rotation/flip to standard orientation</b></p>
    <p>
      This options controls whether the plugin saves frames in the raw orientation as 
      read from the camera rather than rotating and flipping them, if necessary, into 
      the standard orientation at which images are viewed in SerialEM.&nbsp; Image 
      flipping alone does not take significant time, but rotation does.&nbsp; 
      Originally, it took 0.05 seconds 
      for K2 counting mode frames and 0.25 seconds for super-resolution frames, but 
      multi-threading in SerialEM 3.7 has reduced the latter to ~0.1 sec.&nbsp; If 
      you do not care about preserving orientation in the saved frames, you can select 
      this option to reduce frame processing time.&nbsp; However, handedness will be 
      changed if a flipping operation is being skipped.&nbsp; This option is enabled 
      only if the current camera has a nonzero RotationAndFlip property.</p>
    <p>
      If you are saving non-gain-normalized frames from 
      a K2/K3 camera, the 
      defect list stored with the frames will be adjusted for the change in 
      orientation.&nbsp; These defect lists always have a RotationFlip entry showing 
      the orientation to which they apply, and the title in the image file shows the 
      operation applied to the frames after &#39;r/f&#39;, which will be 0 with this option 
      on.</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Other K2/K3 Camera Options</b></i></p>
    <p>
      <b>Save unnormalized frames even if Gain Normalized is selected</b></p>
    <p>
      Select this option to have frames saved without gain normalization even when you 
      have selected gain-normalized processing in the camera setup dialog.&nbsp; With 
      this set, you can leave the processing for Record images as gain-normalized as 
      you turn the saving of frames on and off.&nbsp; You will always get normalized 
      images in SerialEM, and the frames will always be unprocessed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Reduce normalized super-resolution frames by 2 with antialiasing</b></p>
    <p>
      Select this option to save super-resolution frames on K2, or counting 
      frames on K3, with the same number of 
      pixels as the camera chip has, after reducing by 2 with antialiasing.&nbsp; This 
      is the same antialias filtering that is used to reduce the summed 
      super-resolution image to binning 1 or higher for return to SerialEM.&nbsp; Such 
      images have better high-frequency content than the same size counting mode 
      images from the K2 camera because the high-frequency information being thrown 
      away by sampling at the native pixel size is filtered out rather than aliased 
      into lower frequencies.&nbsp; This option can thus be used to get some of the 
      benefits of super-resolution data without having images 4 times larger.&nbsp; 
      For the K2 camera, it will take an additional 3-4 seconds to take 
      super-resolution instead of counting images, plus ~0.1 second/frame to reduce 
      the frames.&nbsp; For the K3 camera, only the time per frame applies.</p>
    <p>
      For a K3 camera, this option is disabled if the option to take frames binned by 
      2 is on in the Camera Setup dialog.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Save normalized data as 16-bit with 100 times scaling of sum (K2 only)</b></p>
    <p>
      This option should not be used; just make sure that you have <i>not</i> selected 
      &#39;Divide 16-bit by 2&#39; and the precision will be as good as with a K3.&nbsp;
      Select this option to have gain-normalized Dose Fractionation frames taken in 
      counting or super-resolution mode saved with 100 times the scaling that is 
      usually applied to a summed image returned to SerialEM.&nbsp; This extra scaling 
      will eliminate the very small loss in camera efficiency (estimated to be only 
      0.05%) that occurs when the 
      mean counts are very low.&nbsp; For counting mode, be aware that counts above 
      about ~16 electrons will be truncated with this extra scaling, for typical K2 
      camera linear gains.&nbsp; Such counts are almost certainly hot pixels unless 
      the mean of the image is over 2-3 electrons/pixel, but this extra scaling has 
      no benefit at that exposure level anyway.&nbsp; For super-resolution 
      mode, there is no truncation, but be aware that the files will be twice the size 
      since the larger counts are stored in 2-byte integers instead of bytes.&nbsp; 
      This option was added before simulations revealed that the efficiency loss from 
      the regular conversion of scaled normalized values to integers was so small (see 
      &#39;Signal loss from saving normalized frames as integers&#39; in
      <a href="about_camera.htm#directDetectors">Direct Electron Detectors, Especially the Gatan K2 and K3</a>).&nbsp; 
      The option is not available for K3 cameras.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Pack unnormalized data as 4-bit (Super-Res) or 4/8-bit (Counting)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      (K2)<br />
      Pack unnormalized data as 4-bit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (K3)</b></p>
    <p>
      This option determines whether Dose Fractionation frames taken without software 
      gain normalization are saved in the form in which they are 
      received by the plugin to DigitalMicrograph (for K2, 16-bit integer for counting mode and byte 
      for super-resolution mode; for K3, bytes) or in a packed form.&nbsp; When this option is 
      selected and not the one described next, K2 counting mode images are truncated into bytes 
      (maximum 255), and K2 super-resolution 
      or K3 unbinned counting mode images are stored with pairs of 4-bit integers (maximum 15) in each byte.&nbsp; (The 
      left pixel in a pair is in the low 4 bits and the right pixel is in the high 4 
      bits of a packed byte.) The data will 
      be raw counts, rather than the scaled values that are saved otherwise (see <A href="about_camera.htm#directDetectors">Direct Electron Detectors,
       Especially the Gatan K2 and K3</A>.)&nbsp; Raw super-resolution images are 
      intrinsically only 4-bit, so there will be no truncation when saving them as 
      4-bit.&nbsp; Packed 4-bit data can be unpacked with the 
      &#39;unpack&#39; or &#39;normalize&#39; command to the &#39;clip&#39; program in IMOD 
      and, in IMOD 4.8.41 or higher, all programs can read these 4-bit data directly.&nbsp; 
      Note that when writing compressed TIFF files, the packing of data is mostly 
      redundant to the compression and may save little additional space, but it should 
      be faster with packed 4-bit data because fewer bytes need to be compressed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Pack unnormalized Counting mode data as 4-bit, not 8-bit&nbsp;&nbsp; (K2)<br />
      Pack unnormalized binned by 2 data as 4-bit, not 8-bit&nbsp;&nbsp; (K3)</b></p>
    <p>
      This option allows counting mode data 
      on a K2, or binned by 2 data on a K3, that is taken without gain normalization to be 
      further truncated at 15 and packed into 4-bit integers, instead of into bytes.&nbsp; 
      This option is enabled and relevant only when the first packing option is 
      selected.&nbsp; If the mean of a frame is only a few electrons per pixel, then 
      counts above 15 are probably spurious and can be safely truncated.&nbsp; 
      Otherwise, this option is not appropriate, so <i>be sure that the mean of your 
      frames is low enough before using it for data collection</i>.&nbsp; This option 
      is not available for K3 cameras.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Use non-standard mode 101 for 4-bit MRC files</b></p>
    <p>
      With this option on, MRC files with 4-bit data will be marked as mode 101 
      instead of mode 0, and the X dimension will be the number of pixels in X instead 
      of half of that.&nbsp; This is a new, non-standard mode supported by some 
      software from UCSF and by IMOD as of version 4.8.41.&nbsp; <i>Be sure that you 
      will be using software that can read these files before saving data in this mode</i>.</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Options for Controlling Folder and File Names</b></i></p>

    <p>
      By default, frames from one exposure are stacked into a file that is named with 
      the date and time and placed in the directory specified when the <b>Set Folder</b> 
      button is pressed in the <a href="#hidd_camerasetup.htm">Camera Setup dialog</a>.&nbsp; 
      This section of the dialog allows you to control the names given to these files 
      by selecting one or more components for the names.&nbsp; In addition, for the K2 
      and Falcon cameras, you can 
      select several of these components to use for naming of folders that are created 
      under the specified main directory to hold subsets of the files.&nbsp; However, 
      for a Falcon 3 camera or Falcon 2 under the new scripting interface, the folder 
      options here are not available if you have specified the name of a folder in the <a href="#hidd_camerasetup.htm">Camera Setup dialog</a>.&nbsp; For the 
      K2, if you select to save one frame per file in the first section of this 
      dialog, then all the statements here about the name of the &quot;file&quot; refer to the 
      name of the directory created to hold the single-frame images.</p>
    <p>
      Two common uses of these capabilities would be:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Tilt series acquisition: Select the file name of the current file as a 
        component of the folder name, and frames for each series will be stored in a 
        separate folder.</li>
      <li>Image acquisition for single-particle reconstruction: Select the label of the 
        Navigator item as a component of the file name, and you will be able to link the 
        frames with a specific location in your map.&nbsp; If you are storing summed 
        images from SerialEM and have the Navigator open a new file periodically (e.g., 
        for each grid square), you could also select the file name as a folder component 
        and have frames stored in a separate folder for each summed image file.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>Base name</b></p>
    <p>
      The base name can be any text that you want (as long as it contains characters 
      that are legal in filenames).&nbsp; It can be used in the name of a folder if 
      you check the box in the left (&#39;Folder&#39;) column, and/or in the name of the files 
      if you check the box in the right (&#39;File&#39;) column.&nbsp; If the text box is 
      empty, nothing is added.</p>
    <p>
      <b>File name of current open file (minus extension)</b></p>
    <p>
      The root name of the current open file in SerialEM (i.e., name without 
      extension) can be used in the name of a folder and/or in the name of the files, 
      depending on which box you check.&nbsp; If there is no open file, nothing is 
      added.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Label of Navigator item</b></p>
    <p>
      If the Navigator is open, the label of the current item or of the item being 
      acquired can be included in the name of the folder and/or the name of the files, 
      depending on which box you check.&nbsp; If the Navigator is not open, nothing is 
      added.&nbsp; If <b>Only when Acquiring at Items</b> is checked, the label will 
      be added only when the Acquire at Items procedure is running.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Sequential number</b></p>
    <p>
      If this box is checked, a number will be added to the file name, starting with 
      the number set in the text box and incremented for each successive file saved to 
      the same location.&nbsp; Use the spin button on the right to set whether the 
      numbers should have 3, 4, or 5 digits.&nbsp; Numbers will have leading zeros so 
      that all numbers have at least the selected number of digits.&nbsp; The number 
      will be reset to the starting number when the folder name changes or when the 
      parts of the filename (if any) in front of the number change.&nbsp; It will also 
      be reset if you change the starting number to be higher than the last used 
      number. The last used number and other information are saved in the settings 
      file, so if you exit from SerialEM and restart with the same settings file, it 
      will be able to resume saving with the next number in sequence. The 
      hour-minute-second component of the name is optional if a sequential number is 
      included.&nbsp; However, it is possible to generate duplicate names when using 
      sequential numbers, so it is recommended that the time component be retained.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tilt angle</b></p>
    <p>
      If this box is checked, the tilt angle will be added to the file name.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Month and day</b></p>
    <p>
      If this box is checked, the date will be added to the file name.&nbsp; This box 
      and the next two are not shown for Direct Electron cameras because the filename 
      before the suffix being controlled here already has a date and a unique number.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Hour, minute, second</b></p>
    <p>
      If this box is checked, a final time stamp will be added to the file name.&nbsp; 
      Unchecking this box will turn on the sequential number selection.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>Numeric date (including year) and time at start of name</strong></p>
      <p>
          This option overrides the separate date and time options and produces a name 
          starting with the year, month as a number, day, and time in the format 
          YYYY-MM-DD_HH.MM.SS.</p>
    <p>
          <strong>Multiple Record hole number and position in hole</strong></p>
    <p>
          If this option is checked and multiple Records are being done, a hole identifier 
          and the position in the hole (0 for central shot, numbered from 1 for peripheral 
          positions) will be added to the file name, separated by &#39;@&#39;.&nbsp; When doing a 
          regular pattern, the hole identifier will have the form &#39;XnYm&#39; where &#39;n&#39; and &#39;m&#39; 
          are relative to the center of the pattern and can be positive or negative.&nbsp; 
          On an axis with an even number of holes, the number is never zero and skips from 
          -1 to +1.&nbsp; For example, a 3x2 pattern will have identifiers X-1Y-1, X+0Y-1, 
          X+1Y-1, X-1Y+1, X+0Y+1, X+1Y+1.&nbsp; When doing a custom pattern, the 
          identifier is simply a number starting at 1.</p>
