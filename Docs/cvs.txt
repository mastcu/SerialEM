Download and extract http://splorg.org/people/tobin/projects/downing/serialem/igloobeta.zip

Download and install ftp://bio3d.colorado.edu/pub/SSHSecureShellClient-3.2.5.exe

Edit the following to reflect your configuration and save it in a batch file called cvs_setup.bat:

SET PATH=%PATH%;e:\cvs\igloobeta
SET CVS_RSH="e:\Program Files\SSH Communications Security\SSH Secure Shell\ssh2.exe"
SET CVSROOT=:ext:tobin@simba.colorado.edu:/home/cvsroot

Try running "%CVS_RSH% -v" and "cvs -v" from the command line to make sure both programs can be found.

Extra credit: Install "GNU utilities for Win32"

This can make the windows command prompt a whole lot more tolerable, giving you all the tools you expect, like "grep" and "less".

== Checking out the Serial EM source ==

You will have to email David Mastronarde to get access to the CVS server (access is restricted by IP address) and to get an account on it (simba.colorado.edu). 

The following will generate and populate a subdirectory called SerialEM:

   cvs co -r SEM_2-3-1_JEOL SerialEM

== Committing changes to CVS repository ==

Note that MSVC is picky about whitespace conventions.

CVS remembers the branch that you checked out (via files in the CVS subdirectory), and your changes will be committed to the same branch.  You can commit your changes with a command like this:

   cvs commit -m "Some text about what I changed" SerialEM
