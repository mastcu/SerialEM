This file had some notes that I sent Tobin long ago - revised 1/17/12 for
hypothetical compilation by others.

1) DOS text file format.  DOS uses CR-LF (^M^A) to terminate lines and unix
just uses LF. Be sure to use the DOS convention in the source files, otherwise
things get terribly mixed up (not so any more, VC fixes it for you).

2) Tabs.  I have tried to replace tabs in my source and avoid inserting
new tabs, although some do creep in.  I removed tabs from your changes.
For consistency, could you set your Visual C parameters to "Tab size 2"
"Indent Size 2" (you already have this) and check "Insert spaces"?

3) The external dependencies such as the JEOL and FEI scopes are included
as .tli/.tlh files in the source code, so specific simulators are not needed
to compile.  However, SerialEMCCD and FocusRamper are assumed to be in 
adjacent directories to the SerialEM source.  That forces a recompile when I
make a relevant change in either of these modules.  Specifically,
CameraController.h does this:
#import "..\SerialEMCCD\SerialEMCCD.tlb" no_namespace
#import "..\FocusRamper\FocusRamper.tlb" no_namespace

So to compile, you need copies of these .tlb's in the relevant directories.
