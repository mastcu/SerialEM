SerialEM uses TIFF libraries which are Copyright (c) 1988-1997 Sam Leffler

Because SerialEM uses the libjpeg library, this software is based in part on
the work of the Independent JPEG Group.  SerialEM also uses the zlib library,
which is Copyright (c) 1995-2010 by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.

SerialEM uses FFTW libraries under a purchased licensed; those are Copyright
(c) 1997--1999 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, written by Matteo Frigo
and Steven G. Johnson.

SerialEM also uses a Set dialog DPI helper class, Copyright (C) 2003 by George
Yohng, and XFolderDialog by Hans Dietrich.
